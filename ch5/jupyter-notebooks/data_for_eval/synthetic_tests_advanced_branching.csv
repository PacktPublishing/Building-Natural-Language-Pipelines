Wut is Micrsoft used for in AI?,"['You may or may not be aware of how pervasive AI is in our everyday lives already. According to one survey of 6,000 consumers, while only 33% of people think that they use AI, over 77% use an AI-powered service or device. It’s not surprising that people are unaware of all the ways AI touches their lives. After all, the development of AI surged over recent years as researchers made strides they didn’t expect to make for another several decades.\nSo what are some common uses and applications of AI? You may be surprised to learn that it can be anything from advanced robotics to the voice search function on your smartphone. We’ll dive into more specific examples below.\nIn this article, we’ll cover:\n What is artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence is a specific branch of computer science concerned with replicating the thought process and decision-making ability of humans through computer algorithms. There are many different branches of AI that can create and do different things. Some types complete simple tasks, while others are much more complex. Some AI programs adjust their own algorithms, and some specialized algorithms are so advanced they can beat human experts in their given fields.\n Examples and applications of AI\nSo what are some examples of AI? Well, it can be almost anything. Your smartphone uses AI, as do services like digital assistants, chatbots, social media websites, and much more. Many home electronics also use AI, such as robot vacuum cleaners or security systems. And, of course, there are classic examples of auto-navigation and robotics.\nBelow, we’ve outlined applications in greater detail so you can understand how AI impacts everyday life.\n Digital assistants\nPerhaps the application used by most people would be the digital assistants on our various pieces of technology. If you have a smartphone or laptop, you probably have and use digital assistant software to some degree.\nSome of the most popular digital assistants include:\n- Siri (Apple)\n- Alexa (Amazon)\n- Cortana (Microsoft)\n- Google Assistant (Google)\n- Bixby (Samsung)\n Search engines\nAnother common application of AI is search engines. Search engine algorithms utilize AI to refine and show better results without the intervention of programmers. You can see this in action on Google if you search a question. You’ll see a section called “People also ask” and if you open one of those questions, it will spawn two more related questions below.\nAn even simpler example is Google’s auto-complete answers when you type in the search bar. An AI algorithm gathers data on what people search most often and uses that to populate predictions you can use to navigate.\nPopular search engines include:\n- Yahoo\n- Bing\n- DuckDuckGo\n']","Cortana is a digital assistant developed by Microsoft, which is one of the popular applications of AI used by many people on their technology.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
Wut is Facebook used for in social media?,"['Social media\nSocial media platforms are another common way people interact with AI. All major social media platforms run off AI-powered algorithms which are designed to serve specific purposes. Most use algorithms to determine what their users like and serve more of that content, to keep the user engaged. Many also run AI algorithms to gather and store user data to use for advertising purposes.\nYou can train your social media algorithms to show the content you like by creating filters, or searching carefully for what you like, and purposefully interacting (liking, commenting, sharing, etc.) with things you enjoy.\nPopular social media platforms include:\n- Facebook (Meta)\n- Instagram (Meta)\n- YouTube\n- TikTok\nOnline shopping\nThis is probably one of the least obvious ways people interact with AI in their daily lives. Many online shopping and ecommerce platforms use AI to streamline their customer experience in a variety of ways.\nAs a customer, you may experience AI through:\n- Personalized product recommendations based on previous shopping activity or customer profile.\n- Pricing optimization based on supply, demand, or previous shopping activity.\n- Chatbots to provide instant responses to customer service or technical issues.\n- Shipping and delay estimates.\nAs a business owner, you may consider implementing AI in the following additional ways:\n- Sales and demand forecasting to help you manage your inventory in the face of increased or decreased demand.\n- Creating customer profiles and segmentation to boost sales.\n- Smart analytics to show in real-time how your business is performing.\nRobots\nThe word “robot” probably makes many people think of sci-fi movies like Star Wars or shows like Star Trek with their humanoid, intelligent robots. Though those may seem futuristic or even far-fetched, in reality, many robots already exist in our world. You may even own some, or something produced by one.\nRobots are used in a myriad of fields to streamline production or keep workers safe. They handle repetitive tasks or anything deemed too dangerous for a human worker. Some examples of industrial robots include:\n- Aerospace: You may be familiar with the Mars rovers NASA has landed over the years. These are programmed to explore, gather samples and send transmissions back to Earth to provide data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain. Most recently, NASA sent the rover Perseverance to Mars to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life.\n- Manufacturing: The use of robots in assembly lines dates back to 1961, when General Motors introduced a robot to assist with welding and transporting die casings (jobs deemed too dangerous for humans). It continues to this day, streamlining production and providing safer working conditions for humans.\n']",Facebook is a popular social media platform that uses AI-powered algorithms to determine what users like and serve more of that content to keep them engaged.,single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

It continues to this day, streamlining production and providing safer working conditions for humans.\n- Hospitality: Particularly in recent years, the hospitality industry has adopted robots to help complete simple tasks and fill in for worker shortages. These can do things like check-in guests at hotels, mix drinks at cafes, deliver meals to tables in restaurants, and more.\n Transportation and Navigation\nYou’ve probably heard of self-driving cars, whether in a sci-fi show or in the news from recent attempts by various companies. But there are more ways that AI is utilized in transportation. Most major map software uses some kind of AI to interpret real-time traffic data and provide routes and ETAs. Additionally, many aircraft use an AI-powered autopilot that takes in weather conditions and flight data to set the course.\nIn fact, studies show that the application of AI in transportation has made it safer, more efficient, and more reliable.\nOther examples of AI in transportation and navigation include:\n- Traffic management systems take in real-time data about the road, weather, and traffic conditions to predict heavier traffic flows and congestion.\n- Direction apps such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze all use location data collected from users to determine traffic, ETAs, and more.\n- Rideshare apps, much like direction apps, use AI that takes in location and environmental data to give ETAs, predict road conditions, and set fare rates.\n Text editing and autocorrect\nAnother example of AI in the palm of your hand (if you have a smartphone, anyway) is autocorrect and other text editing software. This software takes input from generalized dictionaries and common use but also learns from your specific patterns to pick up the words you use most frequently and help you spell them.\nOther online text editors like Grammarly or Hemingway App take standards of style, length, and grammar, and compare them to your texts, generating reports on errors and readability stats. Some of them also analyze other online content in real-time to compare for originality.\n']","NASA has landed Mars rovers over the years that are programmed to explore, gather samples, and send transmissions back to Earth to provide data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain.

How is analytics utilized in the field of AI?,"['Fraud prevention\nIf you have an account with any major bank, chances are they use AI in their fraud detection and prevention systems. These work by analyzing thousands of transactions, and recognizing normal patterns so they can flag suspicious activity. These programs can auto-decline anything suspicious and flag an investigation, as well as notify the individual for verification.\n Predictions\nSince AI can process large amounts of data all at once, it’s useful in identifying patterns and using those to make predictions. Businesses can then use these predictions to make informed decisions or prevent possible future issues.\nCommon uses of predictive AI include:\n- Maintenance: Tracking previous repairs and general wear and tear on parts in equipment allows AI to predict when maintenance needs to happen, preventing inconvenient breakdowns or possible accidents.\n- Modeling: Predictive modeling uses data mining and probability forecasting to predict and estimate future outcomes.\nGaming\nPerhaps surprisingly, AI has been in the field of gaming for years. Over the years, many AI systems were designed to play various games as the developers worked on building software that would learn. AIs have beaten human champions in Chess, Go, StarCraft 2, and also on the game show Jeopardy.\nOf course, many games also utilize AI in their development to continually increase interest and incentives for users to keep playing. Some games that use AI include:\n- Minecraft: uses AI to generate unending virtual environments and adapt to the player’s style.\n- F.E.A.R: uses enemy AI to allow characters to learn and adapt to the player’s movements in game.\n- The Last of Us: has a dynamic AI for each non-player character allowing them to react differently to the player character depending on their specific choices.\n Healthcare\nFrom robotics in hospitals and clinics to predictive software used to diagnose rare diseases, AI has many uses in the field of healthcare. Doctors and medical staff work with AI-powered software to provide better care to patients of all types.\nSome uses of AI in healthcare:\n- Early diagnosis: AI can analyze patient and disease data to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a disease and either diagnose it early or help to prevent it entirely.\n- Disease tracking: Using predictive analytics, AI can model how a contagious disease could spread over the course of time or across a specific area.\n- Drug discovery: AI models can discover new applications or potentially harmful interactions between different drugs.\nAdvertising\nLike many of the above examples, AI has numerous applications in the field of advertising. From offering dynamic ads based on demographics or location to AI that can write the copy itself, AI drives the field of advertising and marketing forward.\nExamples of AI in advertising:\n- Ad creation: AI software can be trained to write copy or even make images based on interaction and purchase data.\n- Dynamic presentation: Many ad platforms allow you to create ads that present different images or text based on customer demographics or location, personalizing the ad experience.\n- Budget optimization: Some ad platforms use AI agents to help determine where an advertiser’s budget goes, focusing budget spending on the best-performing ad on the most cost-effective days and times it to the best-performing ad, day, and time.\nAnalytics\nFinally, another common use for AI is in the field of data science and analytics. One of the most common uses is in predictive analytics, but AI can also be useful in data analysis. Most crucially, using AI analytics helps companies to scale their analytics and allows them to have accurate data at a much quicker rate than before.\nSome common uses for AI in analytics are:\n- Forecasting: Taking in historical data and creating a reasonable forecast of what you can expect to see in the future.\n- Predictive analytics: Predicting trends and future results based on historical data.\n- Business monitoring: Real-time analytics on all key data points, from revenue to cost to customer experience.\nBusiness and AI\nWhile that list of examples may seem extensive, it’s certainly not all-encompassing. ']","Analytics in the field of AI is commonly used for predictive analytics and data analysis. It helps companies scale their analytics and provides accurate data at a much quicker rate.

We document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages bu t even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation top\nic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional sear ch engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.\nAaron Chatterji\nDuke University\nFuqua School of Business and OpenAI\nronnie@duke.edu\nThomas Cunningham OpenAI\ntom.cunningham@gmail.com\nDavid J.

How do industrial robots in manufacturing relate to the use of AI in banking for fraud prevention and predictions?,"['<1-hop>\n\nSome examples of industrial robots include:\n- Aerospace: You may be familiar with the Mars rovers NASA has landed over the years. These are programmed to explore, gather samples and send transmissions back to Earth to provide data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain. Most recently, NASA sent the rover Perseverance to Mars to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life.\n- Manufacturing: The use of robots in assembly lines dates back to 1961, when General Motors introduced a robot to assist with welding and transporting die casings (jobs deemed too dangerous for humans). It continues to this day, streamlining production and providing safer working conditions for humans.\n- Hospitality: Particularly in recent years, the hospitality industry has adopted robots to help complete simple tasks and fill in for worker shortages. These can do things like check-in guests at hotels, mix drinks at cafes, deliver meals to tables in restaurants, and more.\n Transportation and Navigation\nYou’ve probably heard of self-driving cars, whether in a sci-fi show or in the news from recent attempts by various companies. But there are more ways that AI is utilized in transportation. Most major map software uses some kind of AI to interpret real-time traffic data and provide routes and ETAs. Additionally, many aircraft use an AI-powered autopilot that takes in weather conditions and flight data to set the course.\nIn fact, studies show that the application of AI in transportation has made it safer, more efficient, and more reliable.\nOther examples of AI in transportation and navigation include:\n- Traffic management systems take in real-time data about the road, weather, and traffic conditions to predict heavier traffic flows and congestion.\n- Direction apps such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze all use location data collected from users to determine traffic, ETAs, and more.\n- Rideshare apps, much like direction apps, use AI that takes in location and environmental data to give ETAs, predict road conditions, and set fare rates.\n Text editing and autocorrect\nAnother example of AI in the palm of your hand (if you have a smartphone, anyway) is autocorrect and other text editing software. This software takes input from generalized dictionaries and common use but also learns from your specific patterns to pick up the words you use most frequently and help you spell them.\nOther online text editors like Grammarly or Hemingway App take standards of style, length, and grammar, and compare them to your texts, generating reports on errors and readability stats. Some of them also analyze other online content in real-time to compare for originality.\n', '<2-hop>\n\nFraud prevention\nIf you have an account with any major bank, chances are they use AI in their fraud detection and prevention systems. These work by analyzing thousands of transactions, and recognizing normal patterns so they can flag suspicious activity. These programs can auto-decline anything suspicious and flag an investigation, as well as notify the individual for verification.\n Predictions\nSince AI can process large amounts of data all at once, it’s useful in identifying patterns and using those to make predictions. Businesses can then use these predictions to make informed decisions or prevent possible future issues.\nCommon uses of predictive AI include:\n- Maintenance: Tracking previous repairs and general wear and tear on parts in equipment allows AI to predict when maintenance needs to happen, preventing inconvenient breakdowns or possible accidents.\n- Modeling: Predictive modeling uses data mining and probability forecasting to predict and estimate future outcomes.\nGaming\nPerhaps surprisingly, AI has been in the field of gaming for years. Over the years, many AI systems were designed to play various games as the developers worked on building software that would learn. AIs have beaten human champions in Chess, Go, StarCraft 2, and also on the game show Jeopardy.\nOf course, many games also utilize AI in their development to continually increase interest and incentives for users to keep playing. Some games that use AI include:\n- Minecraft: uses AI to generate unending virtual environments and adapt to the player’s style.\n- F.E.A.R: uses enemy AI to allow characters to learn and adapt to the player’s movements in game.\n- The Last of Us: has a dynamic AI for each non-player character allowing them to react differently to the player character depending on their specific choices.\n Healthcare\nFrom robotics in hospitals and clinics to predictive software used to diagnose rare diseases, AI has many uses in the field of healthcare. Doctors and medical staff work with AI-powered software to provide better care to patients of all types.\nSome uses of AI in healthcare:\n- Early diagnosis: AI can analyze patient and disease data to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a disease and either diagnose it early or help to prevent it entirely.\n- Disease tracking: Using predictive analytics, AI can model how a contagious disease could spread over the course of time or across a specific area.\n- Drug discovery: AI models can discover new applications or potentially harmful interactions between different drugs.\nAdvertising\nLike many of the above examples, AI has numerous applications in the field of advertising. From offering dynamic ads based on demographics or location to AI that can write the copy itself, AI drives the field of advertising and marketing forward.\nExamples of AI in advertising:\n- Ad creation: AI software can be trained to write copy or even make images based on interaction and purchase data.\n- Dynamic presentation: Many ad platforms allow you to create ads that present different images or text based on customer demographics or location, personalizing the ad experience.\n- Budget optimization: Some ad platforms use AI agents to help determine where an advertiser’s budget goes, focusing budget spending on the best-performing ad on the most cost-effective days and times it to the best-performing ad, day, and time.\nAnalytics\nFinally, another common use for AI is in the field of data science and analytics. One of the most common uses is in predictive analytics, but AI can also be useful in data analysis. Most crucially, using AI analytics helps companies to scale their analytics and allows them to have accurate data at a much quicker rate than before.\nSome common uses for AI in analytics are:\n- Forecasting: Taking in historical data and creating a reasonable forecast of what you can expect to see in the future.\n- Predictive analytics: Predicting trends and future results based on historical data.\n- Business monitoring: Real-time analytics on all key data points, from revenue to cost to customer experience.\nBusiness and AI\nWhile that list of examples may seem extensive, it’s certainly not all-encompassing. ']","Industrial robots in manufacturing, such as those introduced by General Motors in 1961 for welding and transporting die casings, streamline production and enhance safety in the workplace. Similarly, AI in banking is utilized for fraud prevention by analyzing transaction patterns to flag suspicious activities. Both industrial robots and AI in banking leverage technology to improve efficiency and safety, with robots optimizing physical tasks in manufacturing and AI enhancing security and predictive capabilities in financial transactions.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

We exclude logged-out users, 16 which represented a minority share of ChatGPT users over the\nsample period.\nOur sample is drawn from a table that is itself sampled, where the sampling rate varied over time.\nWe thus adjust our sampling weights to maintain a fixed ratio with aggregate messages sent.\nSampled From a Subset of ChatGPT Users.We construct two samples of classified messages\nfrom a subset of ChatGPT users (approximately 130,000 users). This sample of users does not include\nany users who opted out of sharing their messages for training, nor does it include users whose self-\nreported age is below 18, nor does it include users who have been banned or deleted their accounts.\nThe first sample contains classifications of 1.58 million messages from this subset of users, sampled\nat the conversation level (a conversation is a series of messages between the user and chatbot). This\nsample is constructed such that the user’s representation in the data is proportional to overall message\nvolume. The second sample contains messages sent from this subset of users, sampled at the user level\nwith up to six messages from each user in the group.\n16ChatGPT became available to logged-out users in April 2024, i.e., users could use ChatGPT without signing up\nfor an account with an email address. However, messages from logged-out users are only available in our dataset from\nMarch 2025, thus for consistency we drop all messages from logged-out users.\n6\x0cFigure 1:Illustration of Privacy-Preserving Automated Classification Pipeline (Synthetic Example). Mes-\nsages are first stripped of PII via an internal LLM-based tool calledPrivacy Filter. Then they are classified by\nLLM-based automated classifiers, described in detail in Appendices A and B. Humans do not see raw messages\nor PII-scrubbed messages, only the final classifications of messages.\n', '<3-hop>\n\n3.4 Summarizing Our Approach to Privacy\nWe took measures to safeguard user privacy at every stage of analysis. To summarize, the key elements\nof our approach are:\nAutomated classification of messages.In the course of analysis, no one ever looked directly\nat the content of user messages: all of our analysis of the content of user messages is done\nthrough output of automated classifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed usage data.\nAggregated employment data via a data clean room.We analyze and report aggregated\nemployment data through a secure data clean room environment: no one on the research\nteam had direct access to user-level demographic data and none of our analyses report\naggregates for groups with less than 100 users.\nIn following these measures, we aim to match or exceed the privacy protection precedents set by\nother social scientists studying chatbots and those linking digital platform data to external sources.\nWe follow the precedent established in recent analyses of chatbot conversations (Phang et al.\n(2025), Eloundou et al. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)) that rely on automated\nclassification rather than human inspection of raw transcripts. In particular, Phang et al. (2025)’s\nstudy of affective use of ChatGPT and Eloundou et al. (2025) investigation of first-person fairness in\nchatbots both analyze ChatGPT message content via automated classifiers and emphasize classifier-\nbased labeling as a scalable, privacy-preserving approach. Anthropic’s Handa et al. (2025) used a\nsimilar approach: theirCliomethodology applies automated classifiers to large collections of conver-\nsations, classifying conversations into thousands of topics, and in their appendix they describe manual\nvalidation on sampled conversations (100 user conversations flagged for review and 100 randomly sam-\npled calibrations). Like Eloundou et al., we validate our classifiers using WildChat, a public dataset\nof user conversations.\n9\x0cOther papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant\nprecedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for exam-\nple, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data.\nChetty et al. (2022) analyze de-identified Facebook friendship graphs and anonymized IRS tax records,\naggregated at the zip code level.\n']","The approach to user privacy in the analysis of educational technology usage involves constructing message-level datasets without any human ever reading the contents of a message, ensuring that user privacy is preserved. This is relevant to the generation of creative writing prompts, as the prompts themselves, such as 'Create a short story about a time-traveling astronaut,' can be generated and shared without compromising user privacy. The privacy-preserving measures allow for the collection and analysis of data on technology usage while maintaining the confidentiality of individual users, which is crucial in educational settings where user trust is paramount.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"What are the main conversation topics users engage with ChatGPT for, and how do these relate to user intent in terms of asking for information or performing tasks?","['<1-hop>\n\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\nmessages and 36% ofPractical Guidancemessages are requests forTutoring or Teaching. Another\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% ofPractical Guidance- is general how-to advice on a variety\nof topics.Technical HelpincludesComputer Programming(4.2% of messages),Mathematical Calcu-\nlations(3%), andData Analysis(0.4%).

ChatGPT is also more flexible than web\nsearch even for traditional applications likeSeeking InformationandPractical Guidance, because\nusers receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy\nfootball team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided\ncontent and follow-up requests.\nFigure 9:Breakdown of granular conversation topic shares within the coarse mapping defined in Table 3.

(2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)). However, generative AI is a highly flexible\n16\x0ctechnology that can be used in many different ways. In order to learn more about how people seek to\nuse generative AI at work and outside of work, we introduce a classifier that is designed to measure the\ntype of output the user hopes to receive. Specifically, we classify messages according to user intent,\ncoding up conversations according to a simple Asking,  Doing, or  Expressingrubric. The critical part\nof our classification prompt is as follows:\nIntent Prompt\nAskingAsking is seeking information or advice that will help the user be better\ninformed or make better decisions, either at work, at school, or in their\npersonal life. (e.g. “Who was president after Lincoln?”, “How do I create a\nbudget for this quarter?”, “What was the inflation rate last year?”,\n“What’s the difference between correlation and causation?”, “What should I\nlook for when choosing a health plan during open enrollment?”).\nDoingDoing messages request that ChatGPT perform tasks for the user. User is\ndrafting an email, writing code, etc. Classify messages as “doing” if they\ninclude requests for output that is created primarily by the model. (e.g.\n“Rewrite this email to make it more formal”, “Draft a report summarizing\nthe use cases of ChatGPT”, “Produce a project timeline with milestones\nand risks in a table”, “Extract companies, people, and dates from this text\ninto CSV.”, “Write a Dockerfile and a minimal docker-compose.yml for\nthis app.”)\nExpressingExpressing statements are neither asking for information, nor for the\nchatbot to perform a task.\nConceptually,Doingconversations are delivering output that can be plugged into a production\nprocess, whileAskingconversations support decision-making but do not produce output directly, and\nExpressingconversations have little or no economic content.\n Figure 10 shows the share of messages by each intent type in our sample. 49% of user messages\nareAsking, 40% areDoing, and 11% areExpressing. The figure also shows the relationship with\nour Topic classification: the two taxonomies are correlated but not redundant:Askingqueries are\nmore likely to bePractical GuidanceandSeeking Information.Doingqueries are disproportionately\nWritingandMultimedia.Expressingqueries are disproportionatelySelf-Expression. However, the\noverlap is imperfect. For example, within thePractical Guidancetopic, anAskingmessage might\nbe advice about how to recover from a sports injury given a user’s personal history, while aDoing\nmessage might request ChatGPT to produce a customized recovery and training plan that could be\nprinted or saved. WithinTechnical Help, anAskingmessage might request help understanding how\nto debug some code, while aDoingmessage might ask ChatGPT to write code for the user directly.\nFigure 11 presents shares ofAsking/Doing/Expressingjust for work-related messages.Doing\nconstitutes nearly 56% of work-related queries, compared to 35% forAskingand 9% forExpressing.\nNearly 35% of all work-related queries areDoingmessages related toWriting.DoingandAsking\ncomprise equal shares ofTechnical Helpqueries.\n17\x0cFigure 10:Breakdown of Conversation Topics by Asking/Doing/Expressing category, with topic columns\nsorted by relative share of ”Doing” messages. Prompts for these automated classifiers are available in Appendix\nA. For a detailed breakdown of conversation topic contents, see Table 3. Each bin reports a percentage of\nthe total population. ']","Users engage with ChatGPT primarily for conversation topics related to Writing, where requests often involve modifying existing text rather than creating new content. Specifically, 10.2% of all user messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching, while 36% of Practical Guidance messages fall into this category. Additionally, 49% of user messages are classified as Asking, which involves seeking information or advice, while 40% are Doing messages that request ChatGPT to perform tasks. This indicates a significant overlap between the conversation topics and user intent, with Asking queries more likely to be related to Practical Guidance and Seeking Information, while Doing queries are disproportionately associated with Writing and Multimedia tasks.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
