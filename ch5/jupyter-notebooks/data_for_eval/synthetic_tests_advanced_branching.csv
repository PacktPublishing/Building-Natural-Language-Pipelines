How does DuckDuckGo utilize AI in its search engine functionality?,"['You may or may not be aware of how pervasive AI is in our everyday lives already. According to one survey of 6,000 consumers, while only 33% of people think that they use AI, over 77% use an AI-powered service or device. It’s not surprising that people are unaware of all the ways AI touches their lives. After all, the development of AI surged over recent years as researchers made strides they didn’t expect to make for another several decades.\nSo what are some common uses and applications of AI? You may be surprised to learn that it can be anything from advanced robotics to the voice search function on your smartphone. We’ll dive into more specific examples below.\nIn this article, we’ll cover:\n What is artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence is a specific branch of computer science concerned with replicating the thought process and decision-making ability of humans through computer algorithms. There are many different branches of AI that can create and do different things. Some types complete simple tasks, while others are much more complex. Some AI programs adjust their own algorithms, and some specialized algorithms are so advanced they can beat human experts in their given fields.\n Examples and applications of AI\nSo what are some examples of AI? Well, it can be almost anything. Your smartphone uses AI, as do services like digital assistants, chatbots, social media websites, and much more. Many home electronics also use AI, such as robot vacuum cleaners or security systems. And, of course, there are classic examples of auto-navigation and robotics.\nBelow, we’ve outlined applications in greater detail so you can understand how AI impacts everyday life.\n Digital assistants\nPerhaps the application used by most people would be the digital assistants on our various pieces of technology. If you have a smartphone or laptop, you probably have and use digital assistant software to some degree.\nSome of the most popular digital assistants include:\n- Siri (Apple)\n- Alexa (Amazon)\n- Cortana (Microsoft)\n- Google Assistant (Google)\n- Bixby (Samsung)\n Search engines\nAnother common application of AI is search engines. Search engine algorithms utilize AI to refine and show better results without the intervention of programmers. You can see this in action on Google if you search a question. You’ll see a section called “People also ask” and if you open one of those questions, it will spawn two more related questions below.\nAn even simpler example is Google’s auto-complete answers when you type in the search bar. An AI algorithm gathers data on what people search most often and uses that to populate predictions you can use to navigate.\nPopular search engines include:\n- Yahoo\n- Bing\n- DuckDuckGo\n']","DuckDuckGo, like other popular search engines, utilizes AI in its algorithms to refine and show better search results without the intervention of programmers. This is evident in features such as auto-complete answers and related questions that enhance user navigation.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
Can you tell me about the role of Perseverance in the context of robots and their applications in space exploration?,"['Social media\nSocial media platforms are another common way people interact with AI. All major social media platforms run off AI-powered algorithms which are designed to serve specific purposes. Most use algorithms to determine what their users like and serve more of that content, to keep the user engaged. Many also run AI algorithms to gather and store user data to use for advertising purposes.\nYou can train your social media algorithms to show the content you like by creating filters, or searching carefully for what you like, and purposefully interacting (liking, commenting, sharing, etc.) with things you enjoy.\nPopular social media platforms include:\n- Facebook (Meta)\n- Instagram (Meta)\n- YouTube\n- TikTok\nOnline shopping\nThis is probably one of the least obvious ways people interact with AI in their daily lives. Many online shopping and ecommerce platforms use AI to streamline their customer experience in a variety of ways.\nAs a customer, you may experience AI through:\n- Personalized product recommendations based on previous shopping activity or customer profile.\n- Pricing optimization based on supply, demand, or previous shopping activity.\n- Chatbots to provide instant responses to customer service or technical issues.\n- Shipping and delay estimates.\nAs a business owner, you may consider implementing AI in the following additional ways:\n- Sales and demand forecasting to help you manage your inventory in the face of increased or decreased demand.\n- Creating customer profiles and segmentation to boost sales.\n- Smart analytics to show in real-time how your business is performing.\nRobots\nThe word “robot” probably makes many people think of sci-fi movies like Star Wars or shows like Star Trek with their humanoid, intelligent robots. Though those may seem futuristic or even far-fetched, in reality, many robots already exist in our world. You may even own some, or something produced by one.\nRobots are used in a myriad of fields to streamline production or keep workers safe. They handle repetitive tasks or anything deemed too dangerous for a human worker. Some examples of industrial robots include:\n- Aerospace: You may be familiar with the Mars rovers NASA has landed over the years. These are programmed to explore, gather samples and send transmissions back to Earth to provide data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain. Most recently, NASA sent the rover Perseverance to Mars to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life.\n- Manufacturing: The use of robots in assembly lines dates back to 1961, when General Motors introduced a robot to assist with welding and transporting die casings (jobs deemed too dangerous for humans). It continues to this day, streamlining production and providing safer working conditions for humans.\n']","Perseverance is a rover sent by NASA to Mars, programmed to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life.

These can do things like check-in guests at hotels, mix drinks at cafes, deliver meals to tables in restaurants, and more.\n Transportation and Navigation\nYou’ve probably heard of self-driving cars, whether in a sci-fi show or in the news from recent attempts by various companies. But there are more ways that AI is utilized in transportation. Most major map software uses some kind of AI to interpret real-time traffic data and provide routes and ETAs. Additionally, many aircraft use an AI-powered autopilot that takes in weather conditions and flight data to set the course.\nIn fact, studies show that the application of AI in transportation has made it safer, more efficient, and more reliable.\nOther examples of AI in transportation and navigation include:\n- Traffic management systems take in real-time data about the road, weather, and traffic conditions to predict heavier traffic flows and congestion.\n- Direction apps such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze all use location data collected from users to determine traffic, ETAs, and more.\n- Rideshare apps, much like direction apps, use AI that takes in location and environmental data to give ETAs, predict road conditions, and set fare rates.\n Text editing and autocorrect\nAnother example of AI in the palm of your hand (if you have a smartphone, anyway) is autocorrect and other text editing software. This software takes input from generalized dictionaries and common use but also learns from your specific patterns to pick up the words you use most frequently and help you spell them.\nOther online text editors like Grammarly or Hemingway App take standards of style, length, and grammar, and compare them to your texts, generating reports on errors and readability stats. Some of them also analyze other online content in real-time to compare for originality.\n']","The Mars rover Perseverance is programmed to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life, providing data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
How has AI influenced the game of Chess and what implications does this have for understanding AI's capabilities in strategic thinking?,"['Fraud prevention\nIf you have an account with any major bank, chances are they use AI in their fraud detection and prevention systems. These work by analyzing thousands of transactions, and recognizing normal patterns so they can flag suspicious activity. These programs can auto-decline anything suspicious and flag an investigation, as well as notify the individual for verification.\n Predictions\nSince AI can process large amounts of data all at once, it’s useful in identifying patterns and using those to make predictions. Businesses can then use these predictions to make informed decisions or prevent possible future issues.\nCommon uses of predictive AI include:\n- Maintenance: Tracking previous repairs and general wear and tear on parts in equipment allows AI to predict when maintenance needs to happen, preventing inconvenient breakdowns or possible accidents.\n- Modeling: Predictive modeling uses data mining and probability forecasting to predict and estimate future outcomes.\nGaming\nPerhaps surprisingly, AI has been in the field of gaming for years. Over the years, many AI systems were designed to play various games as the developers worked on building software that would learn. AIs have beaten human champions in Chess, Go, StarCraft 2, and also on the game show Jeopardy.\nOf course, many games also utilize AI in their development to continually increase interest and incentives for users to keep playing. Some games that use AI include:\n- Minecraft: uses AI to generate unending virtual environments and adapt to the player’s style.\n- F.E.A.R: uses enemy AI to allow characters to learn and adapt to the player’s movements in game.\n- The Last of Us: has a dynamic AI for each non-player character allowing them to react differently to the player character depending on their specific choices.\n Healthcare\nFrom robotics in hospitals and clinics to predictive software used to diagnose rare diseases, AI has many uses in the field of healthcare. Doctors and medical staff work with AI-powered software to provide better care to patients of all types.\nSome uses of AI in healthcare:\n- Early diagnosis: AI can analyze patient and disease data to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a disease and either diagnose it early or help to prevent it entirely.\n- Disease tracking: Using predictive analytics, AI can model how a contagious disease could spread over the course of time or across a specific area.\n- Drug discovery: AI models can discover new applications or potentially harmful interactions between different drugs.\nAdvertising\nLike many of the above examples, AI has numerous applications in the field of advertising. From offering dynamic ads based on demographics or location to AI that can write the copy itself, AI drives the field of advertising and marketing forward.\nExamples of AI in advertising:\n- Ad creation: AI software can be trained to write copy or even make images based on interaction and purchase data.\n- Dynamic presentation: Many ad platforms allow you to create ads that present different images or text based on customer demographics or location, personalizing the ad experience.\n- Budget optimization: Some ad platforms use AI agents to help determine where an advertiser’s budget goes, focusing budget spending on the best-performing ad on the most cost-effective days and times it to the best-performing ad, day, and time.\nAnalytics\nFinally, another common use for AI is in the field of data science and analytics. One of the most common uses is in predictive analytics, but AI can also be useful in data analysis. Most crucially, using AI analytics helps companies to scale their analytics and allows them to have accurate data at a much quicker rate than before.\nSome common uses for AI in analytics are:\n- Forecasting: Taking in historical data and creating a reasonable forecast of what you can expect to see in the future.\n- Predictive analytics: Predicting trends and future results based on historical data.\n- Business monitoring: Real-time analytics on all key data points, from revenue to cost to customer experience.\nBusiness and AI\nWhile that list of examples may seem extensive, it’s certainly not all-encompassing. ']","AI has been in the field of gaming for years, with many AI systems designed to play various games, including Chess. Over time, AIs have even beaten human champions in Chess, showcasing their ability to analyze complex strategies and make decisions based on vast amounts of data.

We document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages bu t even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation top\nic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional sear ch engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.\nAaron Chatterji\nDuke University\nFuqua School of Business and OpenAI\nronnie@duke.edu\nThomas Cunningham OpenAI\ntom.cunningham@gmail.com\nDavid J.

Panel C studies variation by education in the frequency of four different conversation topics – Practical Guidance,Seeking Information,Technical Help, andWriting.

Each plot shows unadjusted vs. regression-adjusted estimates, with 95% confidence intervals. We regress each message share on education and occupation, control- ling for the following covariates: age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, seniority within role, company size, and industry. (To guarantee user privacy, we coarsen all covariates to broad categories and programmatically enforce that each group has at least 100 members prior to running the regression) We add the coefficients on each education and occupation category to the unadjusted value for the reference category and compute 95% confidence intervals using the standard errors from the regression coefficients. The sample for this regression is the approximately 40,000 users of the original 130,000 sample whose publicly available occupation was not blank or consisted of strictly special characters (as determined by a classification script). Shares for each user are calculated by randomly sampling up to six conversations attributed to the user from May 2024 through July 2025. 30 6.5 Variation by Occupation Figure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation. Due to privacy-preserving aggre- gation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories – (1) all nonprofessional occupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computer- related occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupa- tions; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care. 26 As above, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents the coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size, and industry. Users in highly paid professional and technical occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work.27 Panel A shows that the unadjusted work shares are 57% for computer-related occupations; 50% for management and business; 48% for engineering and science; 44% for other professional oc- cupations; and only 40% for all non-professional occupations. Regression adjustment moves these figures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in highly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages. Because work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related messages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that areAsking messages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT forAskingrather thanDoing. 28 This is especially true in scientific and technical occupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupa-']","Users with exactly a bachelor’s degree are more likely to send work-related messages, with 46% of their messages being work-related, compared to 37% for users with less than a bachelor’s degree. This trend continues with users who have some graduate education, who send 48% of their messages as work-related. The differences in work-related messaging are statistically significant, indicating that education level plays a crucial role in the likelihood of sending work-related messages.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Reported values are 7-day averages (to smooth weekly fluctuation) ending on the 26th of June 2024 and 26th of June 2025. messages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least$97 billion in 2024 alone in the US. We next report on a classification of messages using a taxonomy developed at OpenAI for un- derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into three broad categories, which we callPractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting.Practical Guidanceis the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation. 7 Seeking Informationincludes searching for information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub- stitute for web search.Writingincludes the automated production of emails, documents and other communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user. Writingis the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June 2025. About two-thirds of allWritingmessages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing, critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages are requests for tutoring or teaching, suggesting that education is a key use case for ChatGPT. Two of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related to computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer programming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025).8 Second, we find the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9% of ChatGPT messages are on the topic ofRelationships and Personal Reflectionand 0.4% are related 7The difference betweenPractical GuidanceandSeeking Informationis that the former is highly customized to the user and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be the same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying times by age and gender (Seeking Information), or they might ask for a customized workout plan that matches their goals and current level of fitness (Practical Guidance). 8Handa et al. (2025) report that 37% of conversations are mapped to a “computer and mathematical” occupation category, and their Figure 12 shows 30% or more of all imputed tasks are programming or IT-related. We believe the discrepancy is partly due to the difference in types of users between Claude and ChatGPT, additionally Handa et al. (2025) only includes queries that ”possibly involve an occupational task”. 2 toGames and Role Play. In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates thatTherapy/Companionshipis the most prevalent use case for generative AI. 9', '<2-hop>\n\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First, we show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time, and may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active users had typically masculine first names. 10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025, with active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that nearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps have narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively faster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and users in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work. We introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is seeking, using a simple rubric that we callAsking, Doing,orExpressing. 11 Askingis when the user is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving models of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and Schneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)).Doingis when the user wants to produce some output or perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al. (2003)).Expressingis when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or action. We estimate that about 49% of messages areAsking, 40% areDoing, and 11% areExpressing. However, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified asDoing(e.g., performing job tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those areWritingtasks. The relative frequency of writing- related conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all white-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by employers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of generative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs such as writing and software code. We also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that about 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining, documenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems, and thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage are highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activitiesGetting InformationandMaking Decisions and Solving Problemsare in the top five of message frequency in nearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales occupations. Overall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT use cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is eitherPractical GuidanceorSeeking Information. We also show thatAskingis growing faster than 9Zao-Sanders (2025) is based on a manual collection and labeling of online resources (Reddit, Quora, online articles), and so we believe it likely resulted in an unrepresentative distribution of use cases. 10Among those with names commonly associated with a particular gender. 11Appendix A gives the full prompt text and Appendix B gives detail about how the prompts were validated against public conversation data. 3 Doing, and thatAskingmessages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier that measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.', '<3-hop>\n\nThis is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is\neitherPractical GuidanceorSeeking Information.

We argue that\nChatGPT likely improves worker output by providingdecision support, which is especially important in\nknowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et\nal., 2023). This explains whyAskingis relatively more common for educated users who are employed\nin highly-paid, professional occupations. Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas\n(2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either asco-workersthat produce output or\nasco-pilotsthat give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.\n2 ']","Demographic variations in ChatGPT usage reveal several important trends. Firstly, the gender gap in usage has narrowed significantly, with the proportion of active users with typically masculine first names dropping from 80% shortly after release to 48% by June 2025, indicating a shift towards more female users. Additionally, nearly half of all messages sent by adults come from users under the age of 26, although age gaps have also narrowed. Furthermore, ChatGPT usage has seen relatively faster growth in low- and middle-income countries over the past year. In terms of work-related and non-work-related messages, it is noted that non-work messages have grown faster and now account for over 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. This trend suggests that while most economic analyses have focused on productivity impacts in paid work, the influence of ChatGPT on home production and non-work activities is equally significant. The findings indicate that educated users and those in high-paying professional roles are more likely to utilize ChatGPT for work, with a notable emphasis on 'Asking' for information and decision support, which is particularly prevalent among these demographics.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing, andSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro- grammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we callAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to']","Users engage with several main conversation topics when utilizing generative AI like ChatGPT. The most common topics include Practical Guidance, Writing, and Seeking Information, which collectively account for nearly 78% of all messages. Within the Writing category, users predominantly request modifications to existing text rather than generating new content, with 42% of work-related messages focusing on Writing. Additionally, 10.2% of all user messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching, indicating a significant educational use case. The user intent can be classified into categories such as Asking, Doing, or Expressing, with about 49% of messages being requests for guidance or information (Asking) and 40% being requests to perform tasks (Doing). This highlights the flexibility of generative AI in catering to various user needs across both work and non-work contexts.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How has the demographic variation in ChatGPT usage changed over time, particularly regarding gender and age, and what impact does this have on overall usage patterns?","['<1-hop>\n\nTeams, Enterprise, Education), which we do not include in our sample. 6Our classifiers take into account not just the randomly-selected user message, but also a portion of the preceding messages in that conversation. 1 Month Non-Work (M)(%)Work (M)(%)Total Messages (M) Jun 2024 238 53% 213 47% 451 Jun 2025 1,911 73% 716 27% 2,627 Table 1:ChatGPT daily message counts (millions), broken down by likely work-related or non-work-related. Total daily counts are exact measurements of message volume from all consumer plans. Daily counts of work and non-work related messages are estimated by classifying a random sample of conversations from that day. Sampling is done to exclude users who opt-out of sharing their messages for model training, users who self- report their age as under 18, logged-out users, deleted conversations, and accounts which have been deactivated or banned (details available in Section 3). Reported values are 7-day averages (to smooth weekly fluctuation) ending on the 26th of June 2024 and 26th of June 2025. messages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least$97 billion in 2024 alone in the US. We next report on a classification of messages using a taxonomy developed at OpenAI for un- derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into three broad categories, which we callPractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting.Practical Guidanceis the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation. 7 Seeking Informationincludes searching for information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub- stitute for web search.Writingincludes the automated production of emails, documents and other communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user. Writingis the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June 2025. About two-thirds of allWritingmessages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing, critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages are requests for tutoring or teaching, suggesting that education is a key use case for ChatGPT. Two of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related to computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer programming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025).8 Second, we find the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9% of ChatGPT messages are on the topic ofRelationships and Personal Reflectionand 0.4% are related 7The difference betweenPractical GuidanceandSeeking Informationis that the former is highly customized to the user and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be the same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying times by age and gender (Seeking Information), or they might ask for a customized workout plan that matches their goals and current level of fitness (Practical Guidance). 8Handa et al. (2025) report that 37% of conversations are mapped to a “computer and mathematical” occupation category, and their Figure 12 shows 30% or more of all imputed tasks are programming or IT-related. We believe the discrepancy is partly due to the difference in types of users between Claude and ChatGPT, additionally Handa et al. (2025) only includes queries that ”possibly involve an occupational task”. 2 toGames and Role Play. In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates thatTherapy/Companionshipis the most prevalent use case for generative AI. 9', '<2-hop>\n\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First, we show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time, and may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active users had typically masculine first names. 10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025, with active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that nearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps have narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively faster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and users in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work. We introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is seeking, using a simple rubric that we callAsking, Doing,orExpressing. 11 Askingis when the user is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving models of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and Schneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)).Doingis when the user wants to produce some output or perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al. (2003)).Expressingis when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or action. We estimate that about 49% of messages areAsking, 40% areDoing, and 11% areExpressing. However, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified asDoing(e.g., performing job tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those areWritingtasks. The relative frequency of writing- related conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all white-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by employers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of generative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs such as writing and software code. We also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that about 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining, documenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems, and thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage are highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activitiesGetting InformationandMaking Decisions and Solving Problemsare in the top five of message frequency in nearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales occupations. Overall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT use cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is eitherPractical GuidanceorSeeking Information. We also show thatAskingis growing faster than 9Zao-Sanders (2025) is based on a manual collection and labeling of online resources (Reddit, Quora, online articles), and so we believe it likely resulted in an unrepresentative distribution of use cases. 10Among those with names commonly associated with a particular gender. 11Appendix A gives the full prompt text and Appendix B gives detail about how the prompts were validated against public conversation data. 3 Doing, and thatAskingmessages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier that measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.']","The demographic variation in ChatGPT usage has shown significant changes over time.

How self-driving cars and AI in banking use technology to improve safety and efficiency?,"['<1-hop>\n\nSome examples of industrial robots include:\n- Aerospace: You may be familiar with the Mars rovers NASA has landed over the years. These are programmed to explore, gather samples and send transmissions back to Earth to provide data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain. Most recently, NASA sent the rover Perseverance to Mars to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life.\n- Manufacturing: The use of robots in assembly lines dates back to 1961, when General Motors introduced a robot to assist with welding and transporting die casings (jobs deemed too dangerous for humans). It continues to this day, streamlining production and providing safer working conditions for humans.\n- Hospitality: Particularly in recent years, the hospitality industry has adopted robots to help complete simple tasks and fill in for worker shortages. These can do things like check-in guests at hotels, mix drinks at cafes, deliver meals to tables in restaurants, and more.\n Transportation and Navigation\nYou’ve probably heard of self-driving cars, whether in a sci-fi show or in the news from recent attempts by various companies. But there are more ways that AI is utilized in transportation. Most major map software uses some kind of AI to interpret real-time traffic data and provide routes and ETAs. Additionally, many aircraft use an AI-powered autopilot that takes in weather conditions and flight data to set the course.\nIn fact, studies show that the application of AI in transportation has made it safer, more efficient, and more reliable.\nOther examples of AI in transportation and navigation include:\n- Traffic management systems take in real-time data about the road, weather, and traffic conditions to predict heavier traffic flows and congestion.\n- Direction apps such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze all use location data collected from users to determine traffic, ETAs, and more.\n- Rideshare apps, much like direction apps, use AI that takes in location and environmental data to give ETAs, predict road conditions, and set fare rates.\n Text editing and autocorrect\nAnother example of AI in the palm of your hand (if you have a smartphone, anyway) is autocorrect and other text editing software. This software takes input from generalized dictionaries and common use but also learns from your specific patterns to pick up the words you use most frequently and help you spell them.\nOther online text editors like Grammarly or Hemingway App take standards of style, length, and grammar, and compare them to your texts, generating reports on errors and readability stats. Some of them also analyze other online content in real-time to compare for originality.\n', '<2-hop>\n\nFraud prevention\nIf you have an account with any major bank, chances are they use AI in their fraud detection and prevention systems. These work by analyzing thousands of transactions, and recognizing normal patterns so they can flag suspicious activity. These programs can auto-decline anything suspicious and flag an investigation, as well as notify the individual for verification.\n Predictions\nSince AI can process large amounts of data all at once, it’s useful in identifying patterns and using those to make predictions. Businesses can then use these predictions to make informed decisions or prevent possible future issues.\nCommon uses of predictive AI include:\n- Maintenance: Tracking previous repairs and general wear and tear on parts in equipment allows AI to predict when maintenance needs to happen, preventing inconvenient breakdowns or possible accidents.\n- Modeling: Predictive modeling uses data mining and probability forecasting to predict and estimate future outcomes.\nGaming\nPerhaps surprisingly, AI has been in the field of gaming for years. Over the years, many AI systems were designed to play various games as the developers worked on building software that would learn. AIs have beaten human champions in Chess, Go, StarCraft 2, and also on the game show Jeopardy.\nOf course, many games also utilize AI in their development to continually increase interest and incentives for users to keep playing. Some games that use AI include:\n- Minecraft: uses AI to generate unending virtual environments and adapt to the player’s style.\n- F.E.A.R: uses enemy AI to allow characters to learn and adapt to the player’s movements in game.\n- The Last of Us: has a dynamic AI for each non-player character allowing them to react differently to the player character depending on their specific choices.\n Healthcare\nFrom robotics in hospitals and clinics to predictive software used to diagnose rare diseases, AI has many uses in the field of healthcare. Doctors and medical staff work with AI-powered software to provide better care to patients of all types.\nSome uses of AI in healthcare:\n- Early diagnosis: AI can analyze patient and disease data to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a disease and either diagnose it early or help to prevent it entirely.\n- Disease tracking: Using predictive analytics, AI can model how a contagious disease could spread over the course of time or across a specific area.\n- Drug discovery: AI models can discover new applications or potentially harmful interactions between different drugs.\nAdvertising\nLike many of the above examples, AI has numerous applications in the field of advertising. From offering dynamic ads based on demographics or location to AI that can write the copy itself, AI drives the field of advertising and marketing forward.\nExamples of AI in advertising:\n- Ad creation: AI software can be trained to write copy or even make images based on interaction and purchase data.\n- Dynamic presentation: Many ad platforms allow you to create ads that present different images or text based on customer demographics or location, personalizing the ad experience.\n- Budget optimization: Some ad platforms use AI agents to help determine where an advertiser’s budget goes, focusing budget spending on the best-performing ad on the most cost-effective days and times it to the best-performing ad, day, and time.\nAnalytics\nFinally, another common use for AI is in the field of data science and analytics. One of the most common uses is in predictive analytics, but AI can also be useful in data analysis. Most crucially, using AI analytics helps companies to scale their analytics and allows them to have accurate data at a much quicker rate than before.\nSome common uses for AI in analytics are:\n- Forecasting: Taking in historical data and creating a reasonable forecast of what you can expect to see in the future.\n- Predictive analytics: Predicting trends and future results based on historical data.\n- Business monitoring: Real-time analytics on all key data points, from revenue to cost to customer experience.\nBusiness and AI\nWhile that list of examples may seem extensive, it’s certainly not all-encompassing. ']","Self-driving cars utilize AI to enhance safety and efficiency in transportation by interpreting real-time traffic data and making informed driving decisions. Similarly, AI in banking improves safety through fraud detection systems that analyze transaction patterns to flag suspicious activities, ensuring secure banking experiences. Both applications demonstrate how AI technology can streamline processes and enhance user safety.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
