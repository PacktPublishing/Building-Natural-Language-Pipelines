How does Google utilize AI in its search engine functionalities?,"['You may or may not be aware of how pervasive AI is in our everyday lives already. According to one survey of 6,000 consumers, while only 33% of people think that they use AI, over 77% use an AI-powered service or device. It’s not surprising that people are unaware of all the ways AI touches their lives. After all, the development of AI surged over recent years as researchers made strides they didn’t expect to make for another several decades.\nSo what are some common uses and applications of AI? You may be surprised to learn that it can be anything from advanced robotics to the voice search function on your smartphone. We’ll dive into more specific examples below.\nIn this article, we’ll cover:\n What is artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence is a specific branch of computer science concerned with replicating the thought process and decision-making ability of humans through computer algorithms. There are many different branches of AI that can create and do different things. Some types complete simple tasks, while others are much more complex. Some AI programs adjust their own algorithms, and some specialized algorithms are so advanced they can beat human experts in their given fields.\n Examples and applications of AI\nSo what are some examples of AI? Well, it can be almost anything. Your smartphone uses AI, as do services like digital assistants, chatbots, social media websites, and much more. Many home electronics also use AI, such as robot vacuum cleaners or security systems. And, of course, there are classic examples of auto-navigation and robotics.\nBelow, we’ve outlined applications in greater detail so you can understand how AI impacts everyday life.\n Digital assistants\nPerhaps the application used by most people would be the digital assistants on our various pieces of technology. If you have a smartphone or laptop, you probably have and use digital assistant software to some degree.\nSome of the most popular digital assistants include:\n- Siri (Apple)\n- Alexa (Amazon)\n- Cortana (Microsoft)\n- Google Assistant (Google)\n- Bixby (Samsung)\n Search engines\nAnother common application of AI is search engines. Search engine algorithms utilize AI to refine and show better results without the intervention of programmers. You can see this in action on Google if you search a question. You’ll see a section called “People also ask” and if you open one of those questions, it will spawn two more related questions below.\nAn even simpler example is Google’s auto-complete answers when you type in the search bar. An AI algorithm gathers data on what people search most often and uses that to populate predictions you can use to navigate.\nPopular search engines include:\n- Yahoo\n- Bing\n- DuckDuckGo\n']","Google's search engine algorithms utilize AI to refine and show better results without the intervention of programmers. This is evident when searching a question, as users can see a section called 'People also ask,' which spawns related questions. Additionally, Google's auto-complete feature uses an AI algorithm that gathers data on frequently searched terms to provide predictions in the search bar.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
Wut r the robots in Star Wars used for?,"['Social media\nSocial media platforms are another common way people interact with AI. All major social media platforms run off AI-powered algorithms which are designed to serve specific purposes. Most use algorithms to determine what their users like and serve more of that content, to keep the user engaged. Many also run AI algorithms to gather and store user data to use for advertising purposes.\nYou can train your social media algorithms to show the content you like by creating filters, or searching carefully for what you like, and purposefully interacting (liking, commenting, sharing, etc.) with things you enjoy.\nPopular social media platforms include:\n- Facebook (Meta)\n- Instagram (Meta)\n- YouTube\n- TikTok\nOnline shopping\nThis is probably one of the least obvious ways people interact with AI in their daily lives. Many online shopping and ecommerce platforms use AI to streamline their customer experience in a variety of ways.\nAs a customer, you may experience AI through:\n- Personalized product recommendations based on previous shopping activity or customer profile.\n- Pricing optimization based on supply, demand, or previous shopping activity.\n- Chatbots to provide instant responses to customer service or technical issues.\n- Shipping and delay estimates.\nAs a business owner, you may consider implementing AI in the following additional ways:\n- Sales and demand forecasting to help you manage your inventory in the face of increased or decreased demand.\n- Creating customer profiles and segmentation to boost sales.\n- Smart analytics to show in real-time how your business is performing.\nRobots\nThe word “robot” probably makes many people think of sci-fi movies like Star Wars or shows like Star Trek with their humanoid, intelligent robots. Though those may seem futuristic or even far-fetched, in reality, many robots already exist in our world. You may even own some, or something produced by one.\nRobots are used in a myriad of fields to streamline production or keep workers safe. They handle repetitive tasks or anything deemed too dangerous for a human worker. Some examples of industrial robots include:\n- Aerospace: You may be familiar with the Mars rovers NASA has landed over the years. These are programmed to explore, gather samples and send transmissions back to Earth to provide data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain. Most recently, NASA sent the rover Perseverance to Mars to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life.\n- Manufacturing: The use of robots in assembly lines dates back to 1961, when General Motors introduced a robot to assist with welding and transporting die casings (jobs deemed too dangerous for humans). It continues to this day, streamlining production and providing safer working conditions for humans.\n']","In Star Wars, robots are often depicted as humanoid, intelligent machines that serve various purposes, similar to how robots in reality are used to streamline production or keep workers safe by handling repetitive tasks or dangerous jobs.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

These can do things like check-in guests at hotels, mix drinks at cafes, deliver meals to tables in restaurants, and more.\n Transportation and Navigation\nYou’ve probably heard of self-driving cars, whether in a sci-fi show or in the news from recent attempts by various companies. But there are more ways that AI is utilized in transportation. Most major map software uses some kind of AI to interpret real-time traffic data and provide routes and ETAs. Additionally, many aircraft use an AI-powered autopilot that takes in weather conditions and flight data to set the course.\nIn fact, studies show that the application of AI in transportation has made it safer, more efficient, and more reliable.\nOther examples of AI in transportation and navigation include:\n- Traffic management systems take in real-time data about the road, weather, and traffic conditions to predict heavier traffic flows and congestion.\n- Direction apps such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze all use location data collected from users to determine traffic, ETAs, and more.\n- Rideshare apps, much like direction apps, use AI that takes in location and environmental data to give ETAs, predict road conditions, and set fare rates.\n Text editing and autocorrect\nAnother example of AI in the palm of your hand (if you have a smartphone, anyway) is autocorrect and other text editing software. This software takes input from generalized dictionaries and common use but also learns from your specific patterns to pick up the words you use most frequently and help you spell them.\nOther online text editors like Grammarly or Hemingway App take standards of style, length, and grammar, and compare them to your texts, generating reports on errors and readability stats.

How is AI utilized in fraud prevention by banks?,"['Fraud prevention\nIf you have an account with any major bank, chances are they use AI in their fraud detection and prevention systems. These work by analyzing thousands of transactions, and recognizing normal patterns so they can flag suspicious activity. These programs can auto-decline anything suspicious and flag an investigation, as well as notify the individual for verification.\n Predictions\nSince AI can process large amounts of data all at once, it’s useful in identifying patterns and using those to make predictions. Businesses can then use these predictions to make informed decisions or prevent possible future issues.\nCommon uses of predictive AI include:\n- Maintenance: Tracking previous repairs and general wear and tear on parts in equipment allows AI to predict when maintenance needs to happen, preventing inconvenient breakdowns or possible accidents.\n- Modeling: Predictive modeling uses data mining and probability forecasting to predict and estimate future outcomes.\nGaming\nPerhaps surprisingly, AI has been in the field of gaming for years. Over the years, many AI systems were designed to play various games as the developers worked on building software that would learn. AIs have beaten human champions in Chess, Go, StarCraft 2, and also on the game show Jeopardy.\nOf course, many games also utilize AI in their development to continually increase interest and incentives for users to keep playing. Some games that use AI include:\n- Minecraft: uses AI to generate unending virtual environments and adapt to the player’s style.\n- F.E.A.R: uses enemy AI to allow characters to learn and adapt to the player’s movements in game.\n- The Last of Us: has a dynamic AI for each non-player character allowing them to react differently to the player character depending on their specific choices.\n Healthcare\nFrom robotics in hospitals and clinics to predictive software used to diagnose rare diseases, AI has many uses in the field of healthcare. Doctors and medical staff work with AI-powered software to provide better care to patients of all types.\nSome uses of AI in healthcare:\n- Early diagnosis: AI can analyze patient and disease data to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a disease and either diagnose it early or help to prevent it entirely.\n- Disease tracking: Using predictive analytics, AI can model how a contagious disease could spread over the course of time or across a specific area.\n- Drug discovery: AI models can discover new applications or potentially harmful interactions between different drugs.\nAdvertising\nLike many of the above examples, AI has numerous applications in the field of advertising. From offering dynamic ads based on demographics or location to AI that can write the copy itself, AI drives the field of advertising and marketing forward.\nExamples of AI in advertising:\n- Ad creation: AI software can be trained to write copy or even make images based on interaction and purchase data.\n- Dynamic presentation: Many ad platforms allow you to create ads that present different images or text based on customer demographics or location, personalizing the ad experience.\n- Budget optimization: Some ad platforms use AI agents to help determine where an advertiser’s budget goes, focusing budget spending on the best-performing ad on the most cost-effective days and times it to the best-performing ad, day, and time.\nAnalytics\nFinally, another common use for AI is in the field of data science and analytics. One of the most common uses is in predictive analytics, but AI can also be useful in data analysis. Most crucially, using AI analytics helps companies to scale their analytics and allows them to have accurate data at a much quicker rate than before.\nSome common uses for AI in analytics are:\n- Forecasting: Taking in historical data and creating a reasonable forecast of what you can expect to see in the future.\n- Predictive analytics: Predicting trends and future results based on historical data.\n- Business monitoring: Real-time analytics on all key data points, from revenue to cost to customer experience.\nBusiness and AI\nWhile that list of examples may seem extensive, it’s certainly not all-encompassing.

Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages bu t even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation top\nic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional sear ch engines.

While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least$97 billion in 2024 alone in the US. We next report on a classification of messages using a taxonomy developed at OpenAI for un- derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into three broad categories, which we callPractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting.Practical Guidanceis the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation. 7 Seeking Informationincludes searching for information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub- stitute for web search.Writingincludes the automated production of emails, documents and other communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user. Writingis the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June 2025. About two-thirds of allWritingmessages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing, critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages are requests for tutoring or teaching, suggesting that education is a key use case for ChatGPT. Two of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related to computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer programming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025).8 Second, we find the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9% of ChatGPT messages are on the topic ofRelationships and Personal Reflectionand 0.4% are related 7The difference betweenPractical GuidanceandSeeking Informationis that the former is highly customized to the user and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be the same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying times by age and gender (Seeking Information), or they might ask for a customized workout plan that matches their goals and current level of fitness (Practical Guidance). 8Handa et al. (2025) report that 37% of conversations are mapped to a “computer and mathematical” occupation category, and their Figure 12 shows 30% or more of all imputed tasks are programming or IT-related. We believe the discrepancy is partly due to the difference in types of users between Claude and ChatGPT, additionally Handa et al. (2025) only includes queries that ”possibly involve an occupational task”. 2 toGames and Role Play. In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates thatTherapy/Companionshipis the most prevalent use case for generative AI. 9', '<2-hop>\n\nThe yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over\n2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been.

For\neach taxonomy we describe a “prompt” which defines a set of categories, and then apply an LLM\nto map each message to a category. Our categories often apply to the user’sintention, rather than\nthe text of the conversation, and as such we never directly observe the ground truth. Nevertheless\nthe classifier results can be interpreted as the best-guess inferences that a human would make: the\nguesses from the LLM correlate highly with human guesses from the same prompt, and we get similar\nqualitative results when the prompt includes a third category for “uncertain.”\n11\x0cFigure 5:Daily messages sent per weekly active user, split by sign-up cohort.

This shift was attributed to changing usage patterns within user cohorts rather than a change in the composition of new users. The findings suggest that while economic analyses have focused on AI's impact on productivity in paid work, the influence of AI on home production activities is on a similar scale, if not larger.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing, andSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro- grammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we callAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to', '<2-hop>\n\nWhat are the topics of ChatGPT conversations?\nWe modify a classifier used by internal research teams at OpenAI that identifies which capabilities\nthe user is requesting from ChatGPT. The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time.

In terms of occupational usage, the data shows that different occupations utilize ChatGPT for various purposes, with Seeking Information being a significant category across many fields. For instance, in the context of work-related messages, Practical Guidance is the second most common use case at 24%, while Writing remains the most prevalent at 40%.

Annotations were carried out by several in-house annotators 31. Table 5 reports agreement rates both among humans and between the model and human annota- tions across all tasks. Task nlabels Fleiss’κ (human only) Fleiss’κ (with model) Cohen’sκ (human vs. human) Cohen’sκ (model vs. plurality) Work Related (binary) 149 0.66 [0.54, 0.76] 0.68 [0.59, 0.77] 0.66 0.83 [0.72, 0.92] Asking / Doing / Expressing (3-class) 149 0.60 [0.51, 0.68] 0.63 [0.56, 0.70] 0.60 0.74 [0.64, 0.83] Conversation Topic (coarse) 149 0.46 [0.38, 0.53] 0.48 [0.41, 0.54] 0.47 0.56 [0.46, 0.65] IWA Classification 100 0.34 [0.23, 0.45] 0.47 [0.40, 0.53] 0.37 — GWA Classification 100 0.33 [0.22, 0.44] 0.47 [0.40, 0.54] 0.36 — Interaction Quality (3-class incl. unknown) 149 0.13 [0.04, 0.22] 0.10 [0.04, 0.17] 0.20 0.14 [0.01, 0.27] Table 5:Validation topline results. ”—” indicates classifiers where only two human annotators participated and a plurality measure was not possible. For each task we report: (i) Fleiss’κacross human annotators; (ii) Fleiss’κwhen treating the model as an additional annotator;', ""<2-hop>\n\n(iii) the mean pairwise human–human Cohen’sκ; and (iv) Cohen’s κbetween the model and the human plurality label. An item contributes to a statistic only if all required raters provided a nonempty label. Confidence intervals are 95% percentile intervals (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) from a nonparametric bootstrap with 2,000 resamples. To annotate these messages, we replicate the procedure from Section 3. For each conversation, the classifier is applied to a randomly selected user message along with up to the 10 preceding messages (each truncated to 5,000 characters). Because this context can be lengthy, human annotators also received a one-sentence pr´ ecis of the preceding messages, generated using the following prompt: ----- You are an internal tool that writes a one-sentence precis of a message from a user to an AI chatbot, based on the context of the previous messages before it. Write a precis of the user intent in the last user message of this conversation, 25 words at most. E.g. 'User is rewriting email to neighbors about plumbing to be more friendly,' or 'User is complaining about grandmother' or 'User is asking for help fixing python databricks error.' 31The IWA classifications were carried out by two annotators, while all other classifications had three. 52 If the conversation changes topic just use the topic of the final message from the user. Always use English in your response. Always start the precis with 'User is.' Don't share anything about the user's name, gender identity, location, email or phone number or anything that could be personally identifiable. For theInteraction Qualitytask, annotators additionally saw the next user message to evaluate any sentiment expressed by the user regarding their level of satisfaction. Because assistant messages tend to be very long, and can require a subject matter expert to evaluate accurately, human annotators were only provided with the final user message, not the assistant response. In-house annotators labeled each item, with ground truth defined as the plurality label 32 when more than two annotators participated. A development set (46 items) was used for prompt and model selection; all results below are computed on a disjoint holdout set. We use GPT-5-mini for all tasks exceptInteraction Quality, for which GPT-5 was selected based on development-set performance. B.1 Results B.1.1 Work-Related Classifier As shown in Table 5, model–plurality agreement is high (Cohen’sκ= 0.83), exceeding the mean human–human agreement (κ= 0.66). The heatmap in Figure 25 indicates close alignment with the human plurality and limited systematic bias. B.1.2 Asking/Doing/Expressing Classifier Human annotations exhibit substantial agreement (mean human–human Cohen’sκ= 0.60), and the classifier improves on this benchmark withκ= 0.74 against the human plurality (Table 5). Figures 26 and 27 show that most confusion arises betweenAskingandDoing; the classifier is somewhat more likely than humans to assignDoing. This pattern suggests that the prominence ofAskinguse cases in our main results is unlikely to be an artifact of misclassification. B.1.3 Conversation Topic Agreement between the model and the human plurality is moderate to substantial (Cohen’sκ= 0.56), improving on the mean human–human agreement (κ= 0.47). Misclassifications are concentrated betweenSeeking InformationandPractical Guidance(Figure 28), which are conceptually adjacent categories. Relative to human annotators, the model under-labelsSeeking Information,Technical Help, andSelf-Expression, and over-labelsPractical Guidance,Multimedia, andOther(Figure 29). 32Ties were broken by a senior annotator. 53 Figure 25:Agreement between Model and Human Plurality.

Human labels were compared with LLM outputs. In practice, we found the ambiguous category was chosen when the user was simply greeting the model or submitted an empty prompt. In this validation set, we report Fleiss’sκfor both the direct IWA classification (κ= 0.47), as well as the GWA aggregation (κ= 0.40). When only examining human outputs we see Cohen’sκof 0.27.

Succes-\nsive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work\nuse has increased.

Specifically, the classifier prompts are designed to determine whether a user message is related to work or not.

This classification process has shown that between June 2024 and June 2025, the share of non-work-related messages grew significantly, indicating that the training of these models directly impacts how user interactions are categorized and understood.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How do the privacy protections implemented in the dataset construction relate to the user privacy considerations in the message-level datasets, especially regarding the age and consent of users?","['<1-hop>\n\nWe describe the contents of each dataset, the sampling procedures that produced them, and the\nprivacy protections we implemented in constructing and employing them in analysis.\n 3.1 Growth Dataset\nWe compiled a dataset covering all usage on consumer ChatGPT Plans (Free, Plus, Pro) since Chat-\nGPT’s launch in November 2022. We exclude users on non-consumer plans (Business f.k.a. Teams,\n14The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and June 26, 2025.\n15The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and July 31, 2025.\n5\x0cEnterprise, Education).\nFor each user and day, this dataset reports the total number of messages sent by the user on that\nday. It also reports, for each message, de-identified user metadata, including the timestamp of their\nfirst interaction with ChatGPT, the country from which their account is registered, their subscription\nplan on each day, and their self-reported age (reported in coarse 5–7-year buckets to protect user\nprivacy).\n', '<2-hop>\n\n3.2 Classified Messages\nTo understand usage while preserving user privacy, we construct message-level datasets without any\nhuman ever reading the contents of a message. See Figure 1 for an overview of the privacy-preserving\nclassification pipeline. Messages are categorized according to 5 different LLM-based classifiers. The\nclassifiers are introduced in more detail in Section 5, their exact text is reproduced in Appendix A,\nand our validation procedure is described in Appendix B.\nSampled From All ChatGPT Users.We uniformly sampled approximately 1.1 million conver-\nsations, and then sampled one message within each conversation, with the following restrictions:\n1. We only include messages from May 2024 to July 2025.\n2. We exclude conversations from users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training.\n3. We exclude users who self-report their age as under 18.\n4. We exclude conversations that users have deleted and from users whose accounts have been\ndeactivated or banned.\n5. We exclude logged-out users, 16 which represented a minority share of ChatGPT users over the\nsample period.\nOur sample is drawn from a table that is itself sampled, where the sampling rate varied over time.\nWe thus adjust our sampling weights to maintain a fixed ratio with aggregate messages sent.\nSampled From a Subset of ChatGPT Users.We construct two samples of classified messages\nfrom a subset of ChatGPT users (approximately 130,000 users). This sample of users does not include\nany users who opted out of sharing their messages for training, nor does it include users whose self-\nreported age is below 18, nor does it include users who have been banned or deleted their accounts.\nThe first sample contains classifications of 1.58 million messages from this subset of users, sampled\nat the conversation level (a conversation is a series of messages between the user and chatbot). This\nsample is constructed such that the user’s representation in the data is proportional to overall message\nvolume. The second sample contains messages sent from this subset of users, sampled at the user level\nwith up to six messages from each user in the group.\n16ChatGPT became available to logged-out users in April 2024, i.e., users could use ChatGPT without signing up\nfor an account with an email address. However, messages from logged-out users are only available in our dataset from\nMarch 2025, thus for consistency we drop all messages from logged-out users.\n6\x0cFigure 1:Illustration of Privacy-Preserving Automated Classification Pipeline (Synthetic Example). Mes-\nsages are first stripped of PII via an internal LLM-based tool calledPrivacy Filter. Then they are classified by\nLLM-based automated classifiers, described in detail in Appendices A and B. Humans do not see raw messages\nor PII-scrubbed messages, only the final classifications of messages.\n']","The privacy protections implemented in the dataset construction involve de-identifying user metadata, such as the timestamp of their first interaction with ChatGPT and their self-reported age, to protect user privacy. In the message-level datasets, user privacy is further preserved by ensuring that no human ever reads the contents of a message. Additionally, users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training are excluded, and users who self-report their age as under 18 are also excluded from the dataset. This approach ensures that the privacy of users is maintained while still allowing for the analysis of usage patterns.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
