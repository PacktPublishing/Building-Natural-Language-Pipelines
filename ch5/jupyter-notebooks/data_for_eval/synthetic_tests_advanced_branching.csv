How does Yahoo utilize AI in its search engine functionalities?,"['You may or may not be aware of how pervasive AI is in our everyday lives already. According to one survey of 6,000 consumers, while only 33% of people think that they use AI, over 77% use an AI-powered service or device. It’s not surprising that people are unaware of all the ways AI touches their lives. After all, the development of AI surged over recent years as researchers made strides they didn’t expect to make for another several decades.\nSo what are some common uses and applications of AI? You may be surprised to learn that it can be anything from advanced robotics to the voice search function on your smartphone. We’ll dive into more specific examples below.\nIn this article, we’ll cover:\n What is artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence is a specific branch of computer science concerned with replicating the thought process and decision-making ability of humans through computer algorithms. There are many different branches of AI that can create and do different things. Some types complete simple tasks, while others are much more complex. Some AI programs adjust their own algorithms, and some specialized algorithms are so advanced they can beat human experts in their given fields.\n Examples and applications of AI\nSo what are some examples of AI? Well, it can be almost anything. Your smartphone uses AI, as do services like digital assistants, chatbots, social media websites, and much more. Many home electronics also use AI, such as robot vacuum cleaners or security systems. And, of course, there are classic examples of auto-navigation and robotics.\nBelow, we’ve outlined applications in greater detail so you can understand how AI impacts everyday life.\n Digital assistants\nPerhaps the application used by most people would be the digital assistants on our various pieces of technology. If you have a smartphone or laptop, you probably have and use digital assistant software to some degree.\nSome of the most popular digital assistants include:\n- Siri (Apple)\n- Alexa (Amazon)\n- Cortana (Microsoft)\n- Google Assistant (Google)\n- Bixby (Samsung)\n Search engines\nAnother common application of AI is search engines.

How Facebook use AI for keep users engaged and what they do with user data?,"['Social media\nSocial media platforms are another common way people interact with AI. All major social media platforms run off AI-powered algorithms which are designed to serve specific purposes. Most use algorithms to determine what their users like and serve more of that content, to keep the user engaged. Many also run AI algorithms to gather and store user data to use for advertising purposes.\nYou can train your social media algorithms to show the content you like by creating filters, or searching carefully for what you like, and purposefully interacting (liking, commenting, sharing, etc.) with things you enjoy.\nPopular social media platforms include:\n- Facebook (Meta)\n- Instagram (Meta)\n- YouTube\n- TikTok\nOnline shopping\nThis is probably one of the least obvious ways people interact with AI in their daily lives. Many online shopping and ecommerce platforms use AI to streamline their customer experience in a variety of ways.\nAs a customer, you may experience AI through:\n- Personalized product recommendations based on previous shopping activity or customer profile.\n- Pricing optimization based on supply, demand, or previous shopping activity.\n- Chatbots to provide instant responses to customer service or technical issues.\n- Shipping and delay estimates.\nAs a business owner, you may consider implementing AI in the following additional ways:\n- Sales and demand forecasting to help you manage your inventory in the face of increased or decreased demand.\n- Creating customer profiles and segmentation to boost sales.\n- Smart analytics to show in real-time how your business is performing.\nRobots\nThe word “robot” probably makes many people think of sci-fi movies like Star Wars or shows like Star Trek with their humanoid, intelligent robots. Though those may seem futuristic or even far-fetched, in reality, many robots already exist in our world. You may even own some, or something produced by one.\nRobots are used in a myriad of fields to streamline production or keep workers safe. They handle repetitive tasks or anything deemed too dangerous for a human worker. Some examples of industrial robots include:\n- Aerospace: You may be familiar with the Mars rovers NASA has landed over the years. These are programmed to explore, gather samples and send transmissions back to Earth to provide data from Mars that an astronaut would be unable to obtain. Most recently, NASA sent the rover Perseverance to Mars to gather samples and search for signs of ancient life.\n- Manufacturing: The use of robots in assembly lines dates back to 1961, when General Motors introduced a robot to assist with welding and transporting die casings (jobs deemed too dangerous for humans). It continues to this day, streamlining production and providing safer working conditions for humans.\n']","Facebook, like other major social media platforms, uses AI-powered algorithms to determine what users like and serve more of that content to keep them engaged.

These can do things like check-in guests at hotels, mix drinks at cafes, deliver meals to tables in restaurants, and more.\n Transportation and Navigation\nYou’ve probably heard of self-driving cars, whether in a sci-fi show or in the news from recent attempts by various companies. But there are more ways that AI is utilized in transportation. Most major map software uses some kind of AI to interpret real-time traffic data and provide routes and ETAs. Additionally, many aircraft use an AI-powered autopilot that takes in weather conditions and flight data to set the course.\nIn fact, studies show that the application of AI in transportation has made it safer, more efficient, and more reliable.\nOther examples of AI in transportation and navigation include:\n- Traffic management systems take in real-time data about the road, weather, and traffic conditions to predict heavier traffic flows and congestion.\n- Direction apps such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze all use location data collected from users to determine traffic, ETAs, and more.\n- Rideshare apps, much like direction apps, use AI that takes in location and environmental data to give ETAs, predict road conditions, and set fare rates.\n Text editing and autocorrect\nAnother example of AI in the palm of your hand (if you have a smartphone, anyway) is autocorrect and other text editing software. This software takes input from generalized dictionaries and common use but also learns from your specific patterns to pick up the words you use most frequently and help you spell them.\nOther online text editors like Grammarly or Hemingway App take standards of style, length, and grammar, and compare them to your texts, generating reports on errors and readability stats. Some of them also analyze other online content in real-time to compare for originality.\n']","Grammarly is an online text editor that takes standards of style, length, and grammar, and compares them to your texts, generating reports on errors and readability stats.

What are some applications of AI in healthcare?,"['Fraud prevention\nIf you have an account with any major bank, chances are they use AI in their fraud detection and prevention systems. These work by analyzing thousands of transactions, and recognizing normal patterns so they can flag suspicious activity. These programs can auto-decline anything suspicious and flag an investigation, as well as notify the individual for verification.\n Predictions\nSince AI can process large amounts of data all at once, it’s useful in identifying patterns and using those to make predictions. Businesses can then use these predictions to make informed decisions or prevent possible future issues.\nCommon uses of predictive AI include:\n- Maintenance: Tracking previous repairs and general wear and tear on parts in equipment allows AI to predict when maintenance needs to happen, preventing inconvenient breakdowns or possible accidents.\n- Modeling: Predictive modeling uses data mining and probability forecasting to predict and estimate future outcomes.\nGaming\nPerhaps surprisingly, AI has been in the field of gaming for years. Over the years, many AI systems were designed to play various games as the developers worked on building software that would learn. AIs have beaten human champions in Chess, Go, StarCraft 2, and also on the game show Jeopardy.\nOf course, many games also utilize AI in their development to continually increase interest and incentives for users to keep playing. Some games that use AI include:\n- Minecraft: uses AI to generate unending virtual environments and adapt to the player’s style.\n- F.E.A.R: uses enemy AI to allow characters to learn and adapt to the player’s movements in game.\n- The Last of Us: has a dynamic AI for each non-player character allowing them to react differently to the player character depending on their specific choices.\n Healthcare\nFrom robotics in hospitals and clinics to predictive software used to diagnose rare diseases, AI has many uses in the field of healthcare. Doctors and medical staff work with AI-powered software to provide better care to patients of all types.\nSome uses of AI in healthcare:\n- Early diagnosis: AI can analyze patient and disease data to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a disease and either diagnose it early or help to prevent it entirely.\n- Disease tracking: Using predictive analytics, AI can model how a contagious disease could spread over the course of time or across a specific area.\n- Drug discovery: AI models can discover new applications or potentially harmful interactions between different drugs.\nAdvertising\nLike many of the above examples, AI has numerous applications in the field of advertising. From offering dynamic ads based on demographics or location to AI that can write the copy itself, AI drives the field of advertising and marketing forward.\nExamples of AI in advertising:\n- Ad creation: AI software can be trained to write copy or even make images based on interaction and purchase data.\n- Dynamic presentation: Many ad platforms allow you to create ads that present different images or text based on customer demographics or location, personalizing the ad experience.\n- Budget optimization: Some ad platforms use AI agents to help determine where an advertiser’s budget goes, focusing budget spending on the best-performing ad on the most cost-effective days and times it to the best-performing ad, day, and time.\nAnalytics\nFinally, another common use for AI is in the field of data science and analytics. One of the most common uses is in predictive analytics, but AI can also be useful in data analysis. Most crucially, using AI analytics helps companies to scale their analytics and allows them to have accurate data at a much quicker rate than before.\nSome common uses for AI in analytics are:\n- Forecasting: Taking in historical data and creating a reasonable forecast of what you can expect to see in the future.\n- Predictive analytics: Predicting trends and future results based on historical data.\n- Business monitoring: Real-time analytics on all key data points, from revenue to cost to customer experience.\nBusiness and AI\nWhile that list of examples may seem extensive, it’s certainly not all-encompassing. ']","AI has many uses in the field of healthcare, including early diagnosis, where it can analyze patient and disease data to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a disease and either diagnose it early or help to prevent it entirely.

We document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages bu t even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation top\nic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional sear ch engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.\nAaron Chatterji\nDuke University\nFuqua School of Business and OpenAI\nronnie@duke.edu\nThomas Cunningham OpenAI\ntom.cunningham@gmail.com\nDavid J.

X’s indicate that the ranking is unavailable since fewer than 100 users from that occupation group requested that specific GWA within the sample. Seven occupation groups are omitted because no GWA was requested by more than 100 users from a single occupation group. These omitted occupation groups (with corresponding SOC2 codes) are ”Healthcare Support” (31), ”Protective Service” (33), ”Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance” (37), ”Farming, Fishing, and Forestry” (45), ”Construction and Extraction” (47), ”Installation, Maintenance, and Repair” (49), and ”Production” (51).

See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between GWA and two-digit SOC2 codes. 35 7 Conclusion This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing, andSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro- grammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we callAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to']","The most common types of requests for Practical Guidance in ChatGPT usage include Tutoring or Teaching, which accounts for 10.2% of all user messages, and general how-to advice, making up 8.5% of total messages.

Educated users are more likely to send work-related messages.\nPanel B explores variation by education in user intent.Askingconstitutes about 49% of messages\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, with little variation for more educated users. After\nregression adjustment, we find that users with a graduate degree are about two percentage points\nmore likely to use ChatGPT forAskingmessages, a difference that is statistically significant at the\n5% level. Prior to regression adjustment, the frequency ofDoingmessages is increasing in education.\nHowever, this pattern reverses after adjusting for other characteristics such as occupation. Users with\na graduate degree are about 1.6 percentage points less likely to sendDoingmessages than users with\nless than a bachelor’s degree, and the difference is statistically significant at the 10% level.\nPanel C studies variation by education in the frequency of four different conversation topics –\nPractical Guidance,Seeking Information,Technical Help, andWriting.

(To guarantee user privacy, we coarsen all covariates to broad categories and\nprogrammatically enforce that each group has at least 100 members prior to running the regression) We add\nthe coefficients on each education and occupation category to the unadjusted value for the reference category\nand compute 95% confidence intervals using the standard errors from the regression coefficients. The sample\nfor this regression is the approximately 40,000 users of the original 130,000 sample whose publicly available\noccupation was not blank or consisted of strictly special characters (as determined by a classification script).\nShares for each user are calculated by randomly sampling up to six conversations attributed to the user from\nMay 2024 through July 2025.\n30\x0c', '<2-hop>\n\n6.5 Variation by Occupation\nFigure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation.

The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text.

Users in highly paid professional occupations, such as computer-related and management roles, are more likely to send work-related messages, with 57% for computer-related occupations and 50% for management and business. Additionally, users with a graduate degree are about two percentage points more likely to use ChatGPT for Asking messages compared to those with less education. For instance, 47% of work-related messages from computer-related occupations are Asking messages, while only 32% come from non-professional occupations.

How does the usage of ChatGPT for work-related messages vary by education and occupation?,"['<1-hop>\n\n37% of messages are work-related\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, compared to 46% for users with exactly a bachelor’s\ndegree and 48% for those with some graduate education. Those differences are cut roughly in half\nafter adjusting for other characteristics, but they are still statistically significant at the less than 1\npercent level. Educated users are more likely to send work-related messages.\nPanel B explores variation by education in user intent.Askingconstitutes about 49% of messages\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, with little variation for more educated users. After\nregression adjustment, we find that users with a graduate degree are about two percentage points\nmore likely to use ChatGPT forAskingmessages, a difference that is statistically significant at the\n5% level. Prior to regression adjustment, the frequency ofDoingmessages is increasing in education.\nHowever, this pattern reverses after adjusting for other characteristics such as occupation. Users with\na graduate degree are about 1.6 percentage points less likely to sendDoingmessages than users with\nless than a bachelor’s degree, and the difference is statistically significant at the 10% level.\nPanel C studies variation by education in the frequency of four different conversation topics –\nPractical Guidance,Seeking Information,Technical Help, andWriting. We find only modest differ-\nences by education across most of these categories. The one exception is that the share of messages\nrelated toWritingis increasing in relation to education.\n28\x0cPanel A.Work Related\nPanel B1.Asking. Panel B2.Doing.\nPanel B3.Expressing.\nFigure 22:(continued on next page)\n29\x0cPanel C1.Writing. Panel C2.Technical Help.\nPanel C3.Seeking Information. Panel C4.Practical Guidance.\nFigure 22:Variation in ChatGPT usage by education. Each plot shows unadjusted vs. regression-adjusted\nestimates, with 95% confidence intervals. We regress each message share on education and occupation, control-\nling for the following covariates: age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, seniority within\nrole, company size, and industry. (To guarantee user privacy, we coarsen all covariates to broad categories and\nprogrammatically enforce that each group has at least 100 members prior to running the regression) We add\nthe coefficients on each education and occupation category to the unadjusted value for the reference category\nand compute 95% confidence intervals using the standard errors from the regression coefficients. The sample\nfor this regression is the approximately 40,000 users of the original 130,000 sample whose publicly available\noccupation was not blank or consisted of strictly special characters (as determined by a classification script).\nShares for each user are calculated by randomly sampling up to six conversations attributed to the user from\nMay 2024 through July 2025.\n30\x0c', '<2-hop>\n\n6.5 Variation by Occupation\nFigure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation. Due to privacy-preserving aggre-\ngation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories – (1) all nonprofessional\noccupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computer-\nrelated occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupa-\ntions; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care. 26 As\nabove, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents\nthe coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the\nname was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size,\nand industry.\nUsers in highly paid professional and technical occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for\nwork.27 Panel A shows that the unadjusted work shares are 57% for computer-related occupations;\n50% for management and business; 48% for engineering and science; 44% for other professional oc-\ncupations; and only 40% for all non-professional occupations. Regression adjustment moves these\nfigures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in\nhighly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages.\nBecause work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related\nmessages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that areAsking\nmessages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely\nto use ChatGPT forAskingrather thanDoing. 28 This is especially true in scientific and technical\noccupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupa-\ntions areAskingmessages, compared to only 32% for non-professional occupations. These differences\nshrink somewhat with regression adjustment, but remain highly statistically significant.\nPanel C presents results by conversation topic.Writingis especially common for users employed\nin management and business occupations, accounting for 52% of all work-related messages. Writing\nis also relatively common in non-professional and other professional occupations like education and\nhealth care, accounting for 50% and 49% of work-related messages respectively.Technical Helpconsti-\ntutes 37% of all work-related messages for users employed in computer-related occupations, compared\nto 16% in engineering and science and only about 8% for all other categories. Regression adjustment\naffects gaps by occupation only modestly. Overall there are stark differences in the distribution of\nconversation topics by user occupation, with work-related messages clearly focused on the core tasks\nin each job (e.g.Writingfor management and business,Technical Helpfor technical occupations).\nWe also present data on the most common Generalized Work Activities (GWAs) associated with\neach broad occupation group, as measured by 2-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes.\nTable 24 presents the frequency ranking of work-related messages in each SOC code of the seven most\ncommon GWAs.29\n26Management and business are SOC2 codes 11 and 13. Computer-related is SOC2 code 15. Engineering and Science\nare SOC2 codes 17 and 19. Other Professional are SOC2 codes 21 to 29. Nonprofessional occupations are SOC codes\n31 to 53.\n27As discussed in Section: Data and Privacy, our dataset only includes users on ChatGPT Consumer plans. Corporate\nusers may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise.\n28Very few work-related messages are classified asExpressing.\n29Appendix D contains a full report of GWA counts broken down by occupation, for both work-related ChatGPT\n31\x0cWe find remarkable similarity across occupations in how ChatGPT is used at work.
