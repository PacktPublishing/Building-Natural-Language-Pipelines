By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population. 1 For a new technology, this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024). This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3 The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations. Two recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways (Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the average chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts. Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages sent by different groups while protecting user privacy. Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025. 5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET task the user is performing.

O*NET associates each occupation with a set of tasks that\nare performed at different levels of intensity. Each task is then aggregated up to three levels of detail\n- 2,087 detailed work activities (DWAs), 332 intermediate work activities (IWAs), and 41 generalized\nwork activities (GWAs).\nTo understand the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage, we mapped messages to one\nof the 332 O*NET Intermediate Work Activities (IWA), with an additional option ofAmbiguousto\naccount for situations where the user message lacked sufficient context. 22 We then used the official\n22We drew a sample of approximately 1.1 million conversations from May 2024 to June 2025, selected a random\nmessage within each, and classified it according to the prompt in A.\n19\x0cFigure 13:Shares of Asking, Doing, and Expressing messages split by work vs. non-work.

We argue that\nChatGPT likely improves worker output by providingdecision support, which is especially important in\nknowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et\nal., 2023). This explains whyAskingis relatively more common for educated users who are employed\nin highly-paid, professional occupations. Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas\n(2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either asco-workersthat produce output or\nasco-pilotsthat give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.\n2 ', '<2-hop>\n\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First, we show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time, and may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active users had typically masculine first names. 10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025, with active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that nearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps have narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively faster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and users in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work. We introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is seeking, using a simple rubric that we callAsking, Doing,orExpressing. 11 Askingis when the user is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving models of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and Schneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)).Doingis when the user wants to produce some output or perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al. (2003)).Expressingis when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or action. We estimate that about 49% of messages areAsking, 40% areDoing, and 11% areExpressing. However, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified asDoing(e.g., performing job tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those areWritingtasks. The relative frequency of writing- related conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all white-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by employers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of generative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs such as writing and software code. We also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that about 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining, documenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems, and thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage are highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activitiesGetting InformationandMaking Decisions and Solving Problemsare in the top five of message frequency in nearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales occupations. Overall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT use cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is eitherPractical GuidanceorSeeking Information. We also show thatAskingis growing faster than 9Zao-Sanders (2025) is based on a manual collection and labeling of online resources (Reddit, Quora, online articles), and so we believe it likely resulted in an unrepresentative distribution of use cases. 10Among those with names commonly associated with a particular gender. 11Appendix A gives the full prompt text and Appendix B gives detail about how the prompts were validated against public conversation data. 3 Doing, and thatAskingmessages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier that measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.']","Zao-Sanders (2025) indicates that their findings are based on a manual collection and labeling of online resources, which likely resulted in an unrepresentative distribution of use cases.

Additionally, it highlights that nearly half of all messages sent by adults were from users under the age of 26, and that educated users in highly-paid professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related tasks.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population. 1 For a new technology, this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024). This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3 The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations. Two recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways (Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the average chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts. Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages sent by different groups while protecting user privacy. Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025. 5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET task the user is performing.

Seven occupation groups are omitted because no GWA was requested by more than 100 users from a single occupation group. These omitted occupation groups (with corresponding SOC2 codes) are ”Healthcare Support” (31), ”Protective Service” (33), ”Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance” (37), ”Farming, Fishing, and Forestry” (45), ”Construction and Extraction” (47), ”Installation, Maintenance, and Repair” (49), and ”Production” (51).

See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between GWA and two-digit SOC2 codes. 35 7 Conclusion This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing, andSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro- grammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we callAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to']","Since its launch in November 2022, the usage of ChatGPT has evolved significantly, with around 10% of the world's adult population adopting the technology by July 2025. The growth in non-work-related messages has been particularly notable, increasing from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. In contrast, work-related messages are more common among educated users in high-paying professional occupations. The three most common topics of conversation on ChatGPT are 'Practical Guidance,' 'Seeking Information,' and 'Writing,' which collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing, in particular, dominates work-related tasks, highlighting the unique ability of chatbots to generate digital outputs compared to traditional search engines.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

We find steady growth in work-related messages bu t even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation top ic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional sear ch engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.

By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population. 1 For a new technology, this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024). This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3 The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations. Two recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways (Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the average chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts. Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages sent by different groups while protecting user privacy. Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025. 5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET task the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us', '<3-hop>\n\nThis is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is\neitherPractical GuidanceorSeeking Information.

While work-related messages have seen steady growth, non-work-related messages have grown even faster, increasing from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. The most common topics of conversation among users include 'Practical Guidance,' 'Seeking Information,' and 'Writing,' which collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations.
