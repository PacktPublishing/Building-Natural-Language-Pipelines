    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to orchestrate multiple specialized nodes working together\n",
    "- How to implement conditional routing based on user needs\n",
    "- How to integrate external tools and APIs into LangGraph workflows\n",
    "- How to add quality control through a supervisor pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system has **6 specialized nodes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarification Node** - Extracts query, location, and detail level from user input\n",
    "2. **Search Node** - Finds businesses matching the criteria - uses the Haystack `business_search` endpoint as a tool\n",
    "3. **Details Node** - Fetches additional info (websites, descriptions) - uses the Haystack `business_details` endpoint as a tool\n",
    "4. **Sentiment Node** - Analyzes customer reviews - uses the Haystack  `business_sentiment` endpoint as a tool\n",
    "5. **Summary Node** - Creates a user-friendly response\n",
    "6. **Supervisor Approval Node** - Reviews quality and can request revisions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Tool implementation](./langgraph_helpers/tools.py)\n",
    "- [Node implementation](./langgraph_helpers/nodes.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "The system allows to flexibly choose the best endpoint for the query and routes back if there is incomplete information (determined by the approval node)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
