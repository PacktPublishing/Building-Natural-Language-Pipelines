    "# Haystack Agent with Dynamic Tool Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "An educational example of building a true **multi-agent system** using Haystack's official `Agent` component with dynamic tool selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to use Haystack's official `Agent` component with multiple tools\n",
    "- How the LLM automatically chooses which tools to call based on user queries\n",
    "- How to implement a supervisor agent that reviews and provides feedback\n",
    "- How to create feedback loops similar to LangGraph's supervisor pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture:  Multi-Agent System with the `Agent` class\n",
    "\n",
    "This system uses **2 Haystack Agent components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Worker Agent** - Has 3 tools and dynamically selects which to use:\n",
    "   - `search_businesses` - Finds businesses on Yelp\n",
    "   - `get_business_details` - Fetches websites and detailed info\n",
    "   - `analyze_sentiment` - Reviews customer sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Supervisor Agent** - Reviews the worker's output and can request revisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference from Previous Implementation:**\n",
    "- Uses Haystack's `Agent` class (not custom components)\n",
    "- LLM decides which tools to call (not hardcoded routing)\n",
    "- Implements true agentic behavior with iterative tool use\n",
    "- Supports feedback loops via pipeline architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start Hayhooks server:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd yelp-navigator\n",
    "uv run sh build_all_pipelines.sh && sh start_hayhooks.sh\n",
    "```\n",

This response does not address the underlying need for actionable restaurant information.\n",

    "## How the Agent Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Tool Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent automatically decides which tools to call based on:\n",
    "1. **Tool descriptions** - The LLM reads the description to understand what each tool does\n",
    "2. **User intent** - It analyzes the query to determine what information is needed\n",
    "3. **Context** - It can chain multiple tool calls (search → get IDs → analyze sentiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internal Agent Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. LLM receives user query + tool descriptions\n",
    "2. LLM decides to call tool(s) → ToolInvoker executes them\n",
    "3. Tool results → Back to LLM\n",
    "4. LLM decides: call more tools OR provide final answer\n",
    "5. Repeat until exit_condition is met (text response without tool calls)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervisor Quality Control\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Worker Agent completes its task (with internal tool loop)\n",
    "2. Supervisor reviews the final output\n",
    "3. Supervisor provides quality assessment\n",
    "4. Returns both the response and quality score\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Feedback Loops:** While LangGraph natively supports cyclic graphs for feedback loops, Haystack's pipeline architecture is designed for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). For production supervisor patterns with feedback, consider:\n",
    "- Running the agent multiple times manually with feedback in the message history\n",
    "- Using the agent's internal `max_agent_steps` for iteration control\n",
    "- Implementing manual retry logic outside the pipeline\n",

    "## Key Differences from Previous Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "| Previous (Custom Components) | Now (Haystack Agent) |\n",
    "|------------------------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| Hardcoded routing logic | LLM decides which tools to use |\n",

    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **True Haystack Agent** - Using the official `Agent` component with tools\n",
    "2. ✅ **Dynamic Tool Selection** - LLM decides which tools to call based on query\n",
    "3. ✅ **Feedback Loops** - Supervisor pattern similar to LangGraph\n",
    "4. ✅ **Iterative Tool Use** - Agent can chain multiple tool calls\n",
    "5. ✅ **Quality Control** - Supervisor reviews and can request revisions\n",
