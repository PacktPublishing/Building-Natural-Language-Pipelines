    "**6 Components:** Clarification, Search, Details, Sentiment, Summary, Supervisor\n",

      "FINAL RESULT: Chicago is a pizza lover's paradise, boasting a variety of styles to satisfy every craving. While the city is renowned for its iconic deep-dish pizza, featuring a thick buttery crust and layers of gooey cheese and rich tomato sauce, there's so much more on offer. Let's explore some top recommendations and sprinkle in a bit of the local flavor and history!\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the deep-dish legends, Lou Malnati's Pizzeria is a must-visit spot, known for its delicious buttery crust and hearty toppings. It's no surprise it's a local favorite, serving up smile-inducing pizzas in a cozy, family-friendly setting. Another giant in the deep-dish world is Giordano's, famous for its stuffed pizzas, which are like a delightful cheesy pie with layers brimming with goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those who prefer a pizza with a lighter touch, check out Coalfire Pizza. They serve a remarkable coal-fired, thin-crust pizza with a crispy, slightly charred edge, making for a perfect contrast to a thicker pie. It's a great choice if you want to change up your pizza game while still experiencing Chicago's culinary creativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pequod's Pizza offers a unique twist on the classic deep dish – their pizzas feature a caramelized crust edge, delivering a perfect balance of crust and cheese that's crispy and scrumptious. It's a popular hangout, with a cozy, laid-back vibe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's not forget the lesser-known but delightful tavern-style pizza, a local go-to for many. These are thin, crispy, and cut into small squares, perfect for sharing with friends. You might stumble upon gems like PIZZ'AMICI, which delivers fresh, mouth-watering pizzas and is perfect for a casual, relaxed meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chicago, pizza is not just food; it’s an integral part of local culture that brings people together, often sparking debates over which style reigns supreme. The variation in taste and preparation techniques across the city allows everyone to find their pizza haven. Whether you're a local or just visiting, Chicago’s pizza scene offers a delicious slice of history with each bite!\n",

    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Query enters through `clarifier`\n",
    "2. State propagates through components\n",
    "3. Components choose outputs based on state (`detail_level`)\n",
    "4. Supervisor approves or sends back via multiplexer\n",
    "5. Components track attempts to prevent infinite loops\n",

    "✅ Native Haystack architecture  \n",
    "✅ Component reusability  \n",
    "✅ Familiar `Pipeline.run()` API  \n",
    "✅ Built-in visualization\n",

    "### Pattern Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "**StateMultiplexer for Feedback:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pipe.connect(\"clarifier.state\", \"search_mux.source_1\")  # Normal\n",
    "pipe.connect(\"supervisor.revise_search\", \"search_mux.source_2\")  # Revision\n",
    "pipe.connect(\"search_mux.state\", \"searcher.state\")  # Merged\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Conditional Routing:**\n",

    "pipe.connect(\"searcher.to_details\", \"details_mux.source_1\")\n",
    "pipe.connect(\"searcher.to_summary\", \"summary_mux.source_1\")\n",
