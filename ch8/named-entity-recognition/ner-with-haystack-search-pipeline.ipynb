But later in the day, Trump praised him and House leaders for producing “a very good Deal,” after they announced a new plan to fund the government and lift the debt ceiling.\\nBefore the new deal was reached, Congressional Democrats mocked their GOP counterparts, with several suggesting Trump had been relegated to vice president.\\n“Welcome to the Elon Musk presidency,” Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California wrote on X.\\nWhat was clear, though, is Musk’s ascendance as a political force, a level of influence enabled by his great wealth. In addition to owning X, Musk is the CEO of Tesla and Space X.\\n“There is no doubt he does wield a lot of influence over Republicans right now due to his proximity to Trump,” said Chris Pack, former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund.\\nBut Pack also said that Musk\\'s threats pose potential risks for House Republicans, who begin next year with a five-seat majority that will shrink temporarily because of Trump’s nomination of some GOP lawmakers to administration posts.\\n“This isn’t going to help pass the agenda if you are going to cost a bunch of Republicans in very razor-thin moderate seats if you’re going to make them lose in primaries,” Pack said. “All that does is give the keys to these districts over to the Democrats.”\\nMusk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support Trump, contributing heavily to America PAC, a super political action committee that deployed canvassers, aired TV ads and reached voters digitally in battleground states. He had signaled after the election he was willing to back GOP primary challenges to Republican members of Congress seeking re-election in 2026 who waver on Trump\\'s appointments and agenda.\\nHe renewed the threat pointedly Wednesday.\\n“Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!” he wrote on X. He also called it “one of the worst bills ever written.”\\nMusk wasn\\'t alone in fanning GOP anger against the bill, which included several compromise measures to get Democratic support in the Senate in the final weeks before Republicans take control of that chamber. Biotech entrepreneur and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is Musk’s partner leading the new Department of Government Efficiency, also posted against the bill, as did Trump\\'s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.\\nMusk played down his role at times, suggesting after some praise online, “All I can do is bring things to the attention of the people, so they may voice their support if they so choose.” And the president-elect told NBC News that he had spoken to Musk prior to the Tesla CEO\\'s first posts.\\n“I told him that if he agrees with me, that he could put out a statement,” Trump said.\\nKaroline Leavitt, the incoming White House press secretary, pushed back against Democratic critics who suggested Musk was calling the shots.\\n“As soon as President Trump released his official stance on the CR, Republicans on Capitol Hill echoed his point of view,\" Leavitt said in a statement, referring to the continuing resolution. \"President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party. Full stop.”\\nThroughout the day Wednesday, Musk replied to posts on X from Republican House members announcing opposition to the bill with words of thanks, and punctuating their public commitments.\\nAnd he took a victory lap after Trump came out against the bill: “The voice of the people was heard. This was a good day for America.\"\\nHe was responding to Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr\\'s post: “The phone was ringing off the hook today. And you know why? Because they were reading tweets...from Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.”\\nBy late afternoon Thursday and before the new plan was put to a vote, Musk declared success and posted a picture of the new, slimmed down alternative alongside the voluminous, original measure he helped kill. “This shows how much your voice matters,” he posted. “And having a President like @realDonaldTrump means that your voice is finally heard.”\\nConservative activists at the annual AmericaFest gathering in Phoenix cheered Musk Thursday and hailed the suggestion he could replace Johnson as speaker. There’s no requirement that the speaker be an elected member of the House of Representatives.\\n“Should Mike Johnson remain speaker of the House?” conservative media host Jack Posobiec asked his audience during a live taping of his talk show, prompting a chorus of “Noooooo!!!” from his audience.\\nJohnson had been scheduled to attend AmericaFest, but canceled after the budget deal fell apart.\\n“Should Elon Musk be speaker of the House?” Posobiec asked his audience, prompting cheers.\\n___\\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

       "  'content': \"LONDON (AP) — It’s a photo that sent a tremor through British politics: Elon Musk flanked by British politician Nigel Farage and a wealthy backer, in front of a gilt-framed painting of a young Donald Trump.\\nTaken this week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the image suggested that Musk, a key player in the incoming U.S. administration, could soon turn his disruptive attention to the U.K.\\nFarage, Trump’s highest-profile British champion, confirmed talks are underway about Musk making a hefty donation to Farage's party Reform U.K. The Times of London reported it could be as much as 100 million pounds ($127 million), which would be far and away the largest political donation in U.K. history. The reports have sparked calls for Britain’s rules on political donations to be tightened — quickly.\\n“We did discuss money,” Farage told broadcaster GB News after the meeting with Musk. “That’s a negotiation we will go back and have again. He is not against giving us money. He hasn’t fully decided whether he will.”\\nBritain has strict limits on how much political parties can spend on elections, but they can accept unlimited donations, as long as the donors are U.K. voters or companies registered in Britain. Musk’s social network X has a British arm, Twitter U.K. Ltd., with a registered address in London.\\nCritics say that is a loophole that allows foreign influence in U.K. politics. The voting watchdog, the Electoral Commission, is calling for changes including limiting the amount a company can donate, so that it can't put in more money than it earns in Britain.\\n“It’s crucial that U.K. voters have trust in the financing of our political system,” the commission's chief executive Vijay Rangarajan told The Guardian. “The system needs strengthening, and we have been calling for changes to the law since 2013, to protect the electoral system from foreign interference.”\\nBritain’s center-left Labour Party pledged during the summer election campaign to tighten the rules on political donations, though legislation is not scheduled in the coming year. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares said Wednesday that work is already underway to “reinforce existing safeguards” against “impermissible proxy donations.”\\nBoth the Labour government and the right-of-center opposition Conservatives are trying to figure out how to deal with Musk, who has taken a keen interest in the U.K. – and seemingly formed a strong dislike for Starmer.\\nMusk often posts on X about the U.K., retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir – shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has “two-tier policing,” with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Musk has compared British attempts to weed out online misinformation to the Soviet Union, and during summer anti-immigrant violence across the U.K. tweeted that “civil war is inevitable.”\",\n",

Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.\\n“OpenAI and Microsoft together exploiting Musk’s donations so they can build a for-profit monopoly, one now specifically targeting xAI, is just too much,” says Musk\\'s filing that alleges the companies are violating the terms of Musk’s foundational contributions to the charity.\\nOpenAI filed a response Friday opposing Musk’s requested order, saying it would “debilitate OpenAI’s business” and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on “far-fetched” legal claims. A hearing is set for January before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California.\\nAt the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\\'s CEO.\\nMusk also sought to be CEO and in an email outlined a plan where he would “unequivocally have initial control of the company” but said that would be temporary. He grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.\\n“The current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI,\" said a 2017 email to Musk from co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman. “You stated that you don\\'t want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you\\'ve shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.”',\n",

Musk\\'s other companies include rocket venture SpaceX and Neuralink, which develops brain implants.\\nTESLA COULD APPEAL THE RULING\\nMusk and Tesla\\'s board could appeal and try to reverse the ruling at the Delaware Supreme Court, a process that typically takes around a year.\\nThe case, which involved the largest-ever pay deal at a U.S. public company, raises issues that have rarely been addressed by Delaware judges, adding uncertainty to an appeal.\\nFor example, the trial court judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, found that Musk controlled the compensation negotiations, even though he owned only about 22% of Tesla\\'s stock.\\nIn addition, Tesla has acknowledged that the June vote by shareholders to ratify Musk\\'s pay was a \"novel\" legal tactic and has said it was unclear how it would be treated under Delaware law.\\nTESLA COULD DEVISE A NEW PLAN\\nTesla\\'s board could craft a new pay package, although that could be very expensive.\\nThe original plan, agreed to by Musk and the company in 2018, awarded him stock options if the company hit very aggressive performance and financial targets. The stock options allowed Musk to buy Tesla stock priced at the 2018 level. The company exceeded the targets, and Tesla\\'s stock has risen 10-fold since then, making the options incredibly valuable.\\nTesla booked a cost of $2.6 billion when the 2018 plan went into effect. The company has said that a replacement plan for the same cost today would likely have to be less than 10% of the size of the 2018 plan.\\nCOULD TESLA JUST RESTORE THE OLD PLAN?\\nTesla could offer Musk the same 304 million stock options with the same $23.34 exercise price used in the 2018 plan.
