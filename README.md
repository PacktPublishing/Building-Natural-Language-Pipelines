## What You'll Learn to Build

This book guides you through building advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with evaluation using the [Haystack 2.0](https://haystack.deepset.ai/), [Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) and [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) frameworks. Starting with NLP fundamentals, you'll progress through creating intelligent search systems, custom components, and production-ready applications. The journey culminates in deploying scalable RAG solutions with proper evaluation frameworks, containerized deployments, and real-world projects including financial document analysis, legal chatbots, and text classification systems.

## Setting up

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Natural-Language-Pipelines.git

cd Building-Natural-Language-Pipelines/

```

Each chapter contains a `pyproject.toml` file with the folder's dependencies. **(Recommended) Open each folder in a new VS Code window.**

1. **Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):**
	```sh
	pip install uv
	```
2. **Change directories into the folder**
3. **Install dependencies:**
	```sh
	uv sync
	```
4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
	```sh
	source .venv/bin/activate
	```
5. **Select the virtual environment as the Jupyter kernel:**
	- Open any notebook.
	- Click the kernel picker (top right) and select the `.venv` environment.
