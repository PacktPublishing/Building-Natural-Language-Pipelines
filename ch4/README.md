# Chapter 4: Building Advanced Haystack Pipelines

This repository contains exercises and interactive notebooks for Chapter 4, focusing on building advanced pipelines with Haystack for different use cases.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):**
	```sh
	pip install uv
	```
2. **Install dependencies:**
	```sh
	uv sync
	```
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
	```sh
	source .venv/bin/activate
	```
4. **(Recommended) Open this `ch4` folder in a new VS Code window.**
5. **Select the virtual environment as the Jupyter kernel:**
	- Open any notebook.
	- Click the kernel picker (top right) and select the `.venv` environment.

6. **Set up API keys:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_key_here
```

To obtain the API keys:
- OpenAI API key: Sign up at [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com)
- Serper API key: Register at [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev)
