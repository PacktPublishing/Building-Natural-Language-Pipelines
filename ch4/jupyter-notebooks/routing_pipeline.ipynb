    "# Building a Routing Pipeline with Haystack\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this notebook where we'll explore intelligent query routing in Haystack. Routing is a powerful pattern that allows you to direct queries to different processing paths based on their characteristics, improving both efficiency and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to implement conditional routing based on query analysis\n",
    "- Different routing strategies: keyword-based, metadata-based, and zero-shot classification\n",
    "- How to create specialized processing branches for different query types\n",
    "- Building a multi-path pipeline that adapts to different user needs\n",
    "- Practical routing patterns for production RAG systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Routing Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all queries are created equal. Some queries:\n",
    "- Require factual lookup vs. conceptual explanation\n",
    "- Need current information vs. historical data\n",
    "- Are best served by different retrieval strategies\n",
    "- Benefit from specialized processing pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing allows your system to intelligently choose the best approach for each query, optimizing both cost and quality."

    "## 2. Understanding ConditionalRouter\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ConditionalRouter` is the most flexible routing component. It evaluates conditions against input data and routes to different outputs based on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jinja2 Expressions**: Use template syntax for complex conditions\n",
    "- **Multiple Routes**: Define as many output paths as needed\n",
    "- **Flexible Logic**: Combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic\n",
    "- **Metadata Access**: Route based on any available metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Type Detection**: Route factual vs. conceptual questions\n",
    "2. **Keyword Matching**: Direct queries containing specific terms\n",
    "3. **Length-Based Routing**: Handle short vs. long queries differently\n",
    "4. **Metadata Filtering**: Route based on query metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important: Default Routes\n",
    "\n",
    "Always include a default/fallback route with `\"condition\": \"{{ True }}\"` as the last route. This ensures that queries not matching any specific condition are still handled gracefully, preventing `NoRouteSelectedException` errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple example that routes queries based on keywords."

    "## 7. Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've learned how to build sophisticated routing systems in Haystack. Let's recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Basic routing with ConditionalRouter\n",
    "- ✅ Query classification and route selection\n",
    "- ✅ Building multi-path RAG pipelines\n",
    "- ✅ Metadata-based routing strategies\n",
    "- ✅ Best practices for production systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Routing enables query-specific optimization\n",
    "2. Different retrieval methods suit different query types\n",
    "3. Metadata can guide intelligent document selection\n",
    "4. Modular design allows independent route optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with your own routing conditions\n",
    "- Add more specialized routes for your use case\n",
    "- Implement monitoring and metrics per route\n",
    "- Explore zero-shot classification for routing\n",
    "- Build adaptive routes that learn from user feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine routing with the hybrid pipeline from the previous notebook\n",
    "- Implement cost-based routing (cheap vs. expensive models)\n",
    "- Add language detection for multilingual routing\n",
    "- Create user-preference-based routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy routing! 🚀"
