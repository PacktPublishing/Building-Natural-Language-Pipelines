The implications include BEV deceleration and hybrid acceleration, with a modest impact on rare earths forecasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sluggish Near-Term US EV Adoption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Global EV/PHEV sales growth in 2024 has been led by China&#8217;s market, with flat or declining performance in the U.S. and EU-5 countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2024, China, EU-5 and U.S. combined EV/PHEV sales reached approximately 1.06 million units, with a sales penetration of 28.6%. China recorded meaningful gains (+6.7% Y/Y), while the U.S. saw a slight rebound (+1.5% Y/Y) and the EU-5 experienced a slight decrease (-0.4% Y/Y).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. EV/PHEV sales penetration rose to 9.6% in April 2024, with EV-specific penetration increasing to 7.5%. However, EV incentives declined 26.0% M/M in April, driven by <strong>Tesla Inc</strong>&#8216;s (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) significant price cuts, according to Peterson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these cuts, EV inventory remained elevated, with a 90-day supply, highlighting the struggle to boost sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8216;The Chicken And The Egg&#8217; Issue</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;chicken and the egg&#8221; issue persists with charging infrastructure, as operators are hesitant to install chargers in low-utilization areas, while EV adoption hinges on reliable charging, the analyst notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, 90% of global fast charger growth occurred in China, with the U.S. lagging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-density areas and multifamily dwellings face additional challenges, increasing lifetime charging costs by $10,000-$26,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hybrid Vehicles: A Cost-Effective Alternative</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid vehicles have reached cost parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles eliminating the need for high-power charging infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2024, 118,435 hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) were sold in the U.S., up 17.8% Y/Y, with <strong>Toyota Motor Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TM#NYSE\">TM</a>) leading the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average price of a hybrid is around $44,000, similar to ICE vehicles and up to $10,000 lower than EVs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">US Automakers Shift Focus To Hybrids Over EVs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. automakers are increasingly focusing on hybrids over EVs. Toyota&#8217;s hybrid sales accounted for 45% of its total volumes, while <strong>Ford Motor Co (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/F#NYSE\">F</a>) aims to double its hybrid F-150 sales to 20%. <strong>Kia Corp</strong> (OTCPK:KIMTF) and <strong>Stellantis NV </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/STLA#NYSE\">STLA</a>) also prioritize hybrids and PHEVs as transitional solutions before expanding their EV offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/39027905/stellantis-plans-to-build-two-more-hybrid-vehicles-in-italy-amid-political-tensions-report\">Stellantis Plans To Build Two More Hybrid Vehicles In Italy Amid Political Tensions: Report</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hybrids Offer A Viable Bridge Solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid penetration is expected to remain significant in the U.S. through the midterm, with forecasts predicting a stable mix of hybrid, PHEV and BEV sales. The global market, previously not expected to exceed 20% hybrid penetration, is now anticipated to reach this level in the next 2-3 years, driven by markets outside China, Peterson notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While EV adoption faces challenges, hybrids offer a viable bridge solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As cost and charging infrastructure barriers are addressed, EVs may eventually gain broader acceptance, but hybrids are set to play a crucial role in the transition to a greener automotive future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read Next: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/05/39004756/teslas-top-chinese-rival-byd-unveils-5th-gen-dm-hybrid-technology-pioneering-1-250-miles-range-r\">Tesla&#8217;s Top Chinese Rival BYD Unveils 5th Gen DM Hybrid Technology, Pioneering 1,250 Miles Range: Report</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>", "symbols": ["F", "KIMTF", "STLA", "TM", "TSLA"], "source": "benzinga"}

The company also reported improving margins as it hones its automation testing centers to boost its efficiency. It slipped back into the red after reporting its first net profit since its 2021 IPO in the previous quarter, though it remained profitable on a non-GAAP basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s climate of uncertainty as the economy slows after years of breakneck growth is actually working to ATRenew&rsquo;s advantage. The company said it is seeing growing numbers of consumers trade in old electronics and other items like gold and luxury goods for cash, keeping it well-stocked with merchandise to feed its operation. At the same time, value-conscious consumers are also increasingly open to buying recycled goods instead of new ones, especially if they come from major vendors like ATRenew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Driven by the action plans at China&rsquo;s national and municipal levels, large-scale trade-in of consumer products has become an important way to promote domestic demand,&rdquo; said founder and Chairman Kerry Chen in the company&rsquo;s latest results announcement. &ldquo;We have observed increased user enthusiasm for trading in used consumer products, with users placing more trust in our recycling and fulfillment capabilities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a policy perspective, this year got off to a strong start when President Xi Jinping called for more recycling of consumer goods and equipment at a meeting of the Communist Party&rsquo;s Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs in February. As often happens in China, those words quickly turned into action a month later when China&rsquo;s State Council, the country&rsquo;s cabinet, released an action plan to promote large scale trade-ins of consumer goods. Following that, local governments have been quick to follow with their own municipal action plans, showing how the central government&rsquo;s priorities often filter down the food chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local governments aren&rsquo;t the only ones acting, as China&rsquo;s major corporate citizens also embrace the call to action. One of those is e-commerce giant&nbsp;<strong>JD.com</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/JD#NASDAQ\">JD</a>), which counts electronics as one of its largest product areas, and is also one of ATRenew&rsquo;s major stakeholders, with 34% of its shares and two places on the company&rsquo;s board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen said JD.com has begun paying &ldquo;greater attention to the second-hand use business,&rdquo; and announced its own plan to promote consumer electronic product trade-ins, including a 3 billion yuan ($415 million) subsidy program in the next 3 years. He noted that as JD.com&rsquo;s &ldquo;exclusive used consumer electronic supply chain partner,&rdquo; ATRenew is directly benefiting from the e-commerce company&rsquo;s stepped-up recycling focus. That helped the transaction value of recycled products through JD.com&rsquo;s trade-in program jump 43% year-on-year in this year&rsquo;s first quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Stock rally</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors weren&rsquo;t particularly impressed with the latest results, at least not on the day of the announcement, with ATRenew&rsquo;s stock down 4.2% in Monday trade. But the much bigger story is a rally that has seen the stock more than double from a low in early February, rising from a close of $1.03 on Feb. 5 to its Monday close of $2.71. That jump has been part of a broader rally for U.S.-listed Chinese stocks that has seen the iShares MSCI China ETF rise more than 30% from a low in late January, though some shares have risen more than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after its rally, ATRenew&rsquo;s stock still trades at a relatively low price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.34, and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8 based on analyst forecasts for this year. Its ratio is slightly behind used clothing seller&nbsp;<strong>Rent the Runway&rsquo;s</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RENT#NASDAQ\">RENT</a>) P/S of 0.41, and also trails the 0.81 for&nbsp;<strong>The Realreal</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/REAL#NASDAQ\">REAL</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATRenew&rsquo;s recent big share gains could indicate some major investors are discovering the stock, and the company currently counts such big names as Morgan Stanley and UBS as major stakeholders, each with 1.3% of its shares. Blackrock also holds 0.4%, according to Yahoo Finance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATRenew continued to leverage its major partnerships with JD.com and&nbsp;<strong>Apple</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>), whose iPhones make up a major portion of its business, to log 27% revenue growth in the first quarter, as the figure rose to 3.65 billion yuan from 2.87 billion yuan a year earlier. It said growth would continue at the same rate in the second quarter, up about 26% year-on-year at the midpoint of its forecast range of 3.67 billion yuan to 3.77 billion yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among its major initiatives, the company made strong gains for its refurbishment business that offers higher margins than simply buying and reselling recycled products. It said its revenue from refurbished devices reached 282 million yuan in the first quarter, accounting for about 8.5% of its total product revenue. That marked a steady improvement from last year&rsquo;s third quarter, when the figure totaled about 200 million yuan, representing 6.8% of product revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company has also been trying to build itself into a multi-category recycling specialist over the last two years, offering not only electronics, but also other products like luxury bags, gold and even vintage liquors. It said the transaction value for that part of its business quadrupled year-on-year in the first quarter to 600 million yuan. Chen also noted that 18% of people who recycled luxury products through the company came back for its other product recycling services within the next 30 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ATRenew is also raising its efficiency bar through a number of other steps, including cutting out middlemen, doing more recycling at the city level instead of nationally, and automating its inspection processes to reduce labor costs and cut down on human errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such efforts helped the company to boost its non-GAAP operating margin to 2.2% in the first quarter from 1.5% a year earlier. It remained profitable on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, which excludes costs related to employee stock compensation and amortization. It reported a non-GAAP net profit of 20.7 million yuan in its latest quarter, down from a 50.1 million yuan profit a year earlier. On the company&rsquo;s earnings call, CFO Rex Chen pointed out that the company was negatively affected by a one-time factor after it subscribed to IPO shares that later declined from an &ldquo;ecosystem enterprise.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"contributor-disclaimer\"><em>This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

Net income rebounded from the non-recurring expenses that affected earnings last quarter, asset quality metrics remained generally favorable, and the industry's liquidity was stable. However, the industry's net interest margin declined as competition continued to pressure rates paid on deposits and asset yields declined.&nbsp;</p><p>The banking industry's net income of $64.2 billion in the first quarter was an increase of 79.5 percent from the prior quarter, mainly due to lower expense related to the FDIC special assessment and lower goodwill writedowns.&nbsp; Otherwise, net income in the first quarter would have increased 14.3 percent from the prior quarter as higher noninterest income and lower provision expenses more than offset a decline in net interest income.</p><p>Community banks reported net income of $6.3 billion, a quarterly increase of 6.1 percent, driven by better results on the sale of securities and lower noninterest and provision expenses.</p><p>The industry's net interest margin declined by 10 basis points to 3.17 percent, below the pre-pandemic average of 3.25 percent.<a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/fdic-quarterly-banking-profile-first-quarter-2024#footnote1_fML5xYJkbYj0\"><strong>1</strong></a>&nbsp;Continued deposit competition caused funding costs to increase during the quarter while the yield on earning assets declined. The net interest margin for community banks also declined in the first quarter and remains below its pre-pandemic average.</p><p>Unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities increased by $39 billion to $517 billion in the first quarter.&nbsp;Higher unrealized losses on residential mortgage-backed securities, resulting from higher mortgage rates in the first quarter, drove the overall increase. This is the ninth straight quarter of unusually high unrealized losses since the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in first quarter 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The industry's total loans declined by $35 billion, or 0.3 percent, in the first quarter. Most of the decline was reported by the largest banks, in line with a seasonal decline in credit&nbsp;card loans and lower auto loan balances. The industry's year-over-year loan growth rate of 1.7 percent, the slowest rate of annual growth since third quarter 2021, has steadily declined over the past year. The annual increase was led by credit card loans and CRE loans.&nbsp;Loan growth at community banks was more robust, increasing 0.9 percent from the prior quarter and 7.1 percent from the prior year, led by CRE and residential mortgage loans.</p><p>Asset quality metrics were generally favorable with the exception of material deterioration in CRE and credit card portfolios.<a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/fdic-quarterly-banking-profile-first-quarter-2024#footnote2_eNxLwunzzaeG\"><strong>2</strong></a>&nbsp;The industry's noncurrent rate increased five basis points from the prior quarter to 0.91 percent, a level still well below the pre-pandemic average noncurrent rate of 1.28 percent.<a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/fdic-quarterly-banking-profile-first-quarter-2024#footnote3_zcVkxQJV8s6o\"><strong>3</strong></a></p><p>The increase in noncurrent loan balances continued among&nbsp;non-owner occupied CRE loans, driven by office loans at the largest banks, those with assets greater than $250 billion. The next tier of banks, those with total assets between $10 billion and $250 billion in assets, is also showing some stress in non-owner occupied CRE loans. Weak demand for office space is softening property values, and higher interest rates are affecting the credit quality and refinancing ability of office and other types of CRE loans. As a result, the noncurrent rate for non-owner occupied CRE loans is now at its highest level since fourth quarter 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>Driven by write-downs on credit cards, the industry's quarterly net charge-off rate remained at 0.65 percent for the second straight quarter, 24 basis points higher than the prior year's rate. The current net charge-off rate is 17 basis points higher than the pre-pandemic average. The credit card net charge-off rate was the highest rate since third quarter 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Domestic deposits increased for a second consecutive quarter, this quarter by $191 billion, driven by growth in transaction accounts. The shift away from noninterest-bearing deposits toward interest-bearing deposits continued, as interest-bearing deposits increased 1.7 percent quarter over quarter and noninterest-bearing deposits declined for the eighth consecutive quarter. Estimated uninsured deposits increased $63 billion in the quarter, representing the first reported increase since fourth quarter 2021.</p><p>The number of banks on the Problem Bank List, those with a CAMELS composite rating of \"4\" or \"5,\" increased from 52 in fourth quarter 2023 to 63 in first quarter 2024. The number of problem banks represented 1.4 percent of total banks, which was within the normal range for non-crisis periods of one to two percent of all banks.&nbsp; Total assets held by problem banks increased $15.8 billion to $82.1 billion during the quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>The Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance was $125.3 billion on March 31, up $3.5 billion from the end of the fourth quarter. Insured deposits increased by 1.1 percent, about half of typical growth in the first quarter. The reserve ratio, or the fund balance relative to insured deposits, increased by two basis points to 1.17 percent. The reserve ratio currently remains on track to reach the 1.35 percent minimum reserve ratio by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028.</p><p>In conclusion, the banking industry&nbsp;continued to show resilience in the first quarter. However, the banking industry still faces significant downside risks from the continued effects of inflation, volatility in market interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. These issues could cause credit quality, earnings, and liquidity challenges for the industry. In addition, deterioration in certain loan portfolios, particularly office properties and credit card loans, continues to warrant monitoring. These issues, together with funding and margin pressures,&nbsp;will remain matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you.</p>", "symbols": ["KBE", "KRE", "SPY", "XLF"], "source": "benzinga"}

As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market&#39;s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let&#39;s dive into the stock analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>SPY (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>) is currently trading around our level of 526.31. For bullish momentum, we are looking for an initial push to 527.36. If the price action sustains above 527.36, we anticipate buyers driving the price to our next target of 528.66. Should 528.66 hold during regular trading hours, we expect a further move up to 530.09. Our high bullish target for SPY today is set at 530.77.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 526.31 fails to act as support, we foresee a test of 525.26 by the bears. Continued selling pressure could bring the price down to 523.76. Should 523.76 break on heavy selling, we have a robust support level at 522.84. In the event of a severe sell-off, our low bearish target for the day is 521.85.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Q&#39;s&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QQQ#NASDAQ\">QQQ</a>) are currently trading around our key level of 456.23. For a bullish scenario, we need to see buyers stepping in above 456.23. If this level holds as support, our next target is 457.55. Sustained buying could push the price to 458.83. If the market strength continues, we might see a test of 460.55. The high bullish target for the Q&#39;s today is 462.14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 456.23 does not hold during regular trading hours, we expect the bears to drive the price down to 455.29. Weakness in the market could lead to a test of 454.10. Persistent selling pressure might push the price further down to 452.98. If this level breaks, our low bearish target for the day is 452.14.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Apple Inc.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) is currently trading around our level of 189.44. For a bullish outlook, we need 189.44 to hold as support. If buyers maintain control, we expect a rally to 190.52. Continued bullish momentum could push the price to 191.57. If the bulls dominate today, our high bullish target for Apple is 192.27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should 189.44 fail to hold as support, we anticipate a test of 188.56. Further selling pressure could bring the price down to 188.20. Continued downward momentum might push the price to 187.50. If this level breaks, our low bearish target for Apple is 186.99.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\">MSFT</a>) is currently trading around our level of 427.36. For a bullish scenario, we need the price to stay above 428.48, turning it into support during regular trading hours. Holding this key level could drive the price up to 429.25. Continued buying momentum might push the price to our high bullish target of 430.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 427.36 fails to act as support, we expect a test of 426.00 by the bears. Breaking this level could lead to a move down to 425.16. Persistent selling pressure might push the price further to 423.81. Our low bearish target for Microsoft today is 422.84.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>NVIDIA Corporation </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>NVIDIA (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) is currently trading around our key level of 1,136.80.

Continued selling pressure could bring the price down to 172.28. If this level breaks, our low bearish target for Alphabet today is 171.14.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Meta Platforms Inc</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meta&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>) is currently trading around our level of 475.19. For a bullish outlook, we need the price to stay above 475.19 and turn it into support. A strong bullish auction could push the price to 477.50. Continued buying might drive the price up to 479.47. The high bullish target for Meta is 480.96.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 475.19 does not hold as support, we expect the bears to push the price down to 473.93.

If this level breaks, our low bearish target for Meta today is 470.28.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tesla Inc. </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) is currently trading around our key level of 176.34. To the upside, we want to see the bulls push the price up to 179.79. Continued buying could lead to a rally to our key level of 182.53. If a broader market rally occurs, Tesla might test 184.10. On a strong bullish day, the high bullish target for Tesla is 186.10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If 176.34 fails to hold as support, we anticipate a test of 172.61.

As well as tobacco products, the FDA also regulates drugs, foods, cosmetics and more to ensure safety and efficacy.</p><p>\"The FDA is a data-driven agency, and we're in the process of reviewing the available data to inform potential actions in this space,\" it said in response to Reuters' questions.</p><p>Three academic researchers told the news agency that current studies of 6-methyl nicotine are too limited to draw definite conclusions on the health impact or to what degree it is addictive.</p><p>Imad Damaj, a professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University, said his research showed 6-methyl nicotine may be more potent than nicotine, but more extensive tests were needed to say what impact it has on humans.</p><p>The limitations of existing research included that some papers were industry funded, while others focused on the short-term impact on animals or cells and were insufficient to understand 6-methyl nicotine's effects on human bodies, the researchers said.</p><p>Charlie's Holdings calls the 6-methyl nicotine solution used in SPREE BAR Metatine. <a href=\"https://spreebar.com/metatine/\">SPREE BAR's website, opens new tab</a> says Metatine \"may have a toxicity profile similar to nicotine\".</p><p>SPREE BAR promises users 6,000 puffs from each device and offers fruity flavours including \"blue razz ice\" and \"creamy melon\", according to its website.</p><p>The FDA has yet to approve any flavoured vape using traditional nicotine for sale in the United States, saying companies have not been able to show that the health benefits they offer to smokers outweigh the known risks to young people, who may be more attracted by the flavours.</p><p>Charlie's Holdings co-founder Ryan Stump told Reuters that the company only targets adults, adding that flavours played an important role in its mission to help smokers quit cigarettes.</p><p>Stump said Charlie's Holdings respects and abides by laws in every market where it operates. He acknowledged that more research is needed on 6-methyl nicotine, adding that the company dilutes it in its products.</p><h2>TARGETING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS</h2><p>Anes Saleh sells SPREE BAR in his vape shop in Denver, Colorado, called Sultan Smoke. He said he has some customers who only buy Spree Bar instead of a nicotine vape and he hasn't had any negative feedback on the product.</p><p>\"The only... protest I would hear about people not wanting to try this is that they don't know what Metatine is or does,\" he said.</p><p>Stump said that Charlie's Holdings is working on new varieties of SPREE BAR and new products using 6-methyl nicotine. It will launch SPREE BAR internationally this year. He declined to say where.</p><p>The company buys the 6-methyl nicotine solution used in SPREE BAR from another U.S. firm, Novel Compounds, according to Novel Compounds' founder Samuel Benaim.</p><p>Novel Compounds imports 6-methyl nicotine from overseas and alters it to make it easier for manufacturers like Charlie's Holdings to use in their products. It sells this solution under the trade name imotine.</p><p>Tests commissioned by Novel Compounds have found 6-methyl nicotine to be no more harmful than nicotine, Benaim said. But he also said that more research was needed into the chemical.</p><p>Benaim added that Novel Compounds had received legal advice that its product is not classified as a tobacco product or drug in the United States. The company is committed to legal compliance, he said.</p><h2>MORE POTENT THAN NICOTINE?</h2><p>Sven Jordt, a professor at Duke University, who has authored papers on products like SPREE BAR, said 6-methyl nicotine could me more addictive and toxic than its traditional cousin.</p><p>\"Do we want to have such a chemical as a recreational product, available to anyone?,\" he asked. \"That's really questionable.\"</p><p>Neither Jordt nor Damaj - the professor at Virginia Commonwealth University - have received funding from tobacco or vape makers.</p><p>As well as the United States, Novel Compounds also sells its 6-methyl nicotine solution around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, India and Japan.</p><p>Another company, Aroma King, sells 6-methyl nicotine in the United Kingdom in pouches, which users insert under the lip to get a buzz. The pouches are sold in cans emblazoned with graphics of gorillas in suits and sunglasses.</p><p>It said in a February <a href=\"https://mkpodplug.co.uk/blogs/snus-news/understanding-nonic-by-aroma-king\">blog post, opens new tab</a> that its 6-methyl nicotine products were \"less toxic\", \"less harmful\", and \"less addictive\" than regular nicotine products.</p><p>In a statement to Reuters, Aroma King cited existing research, its own toxicology and other tests and its supplier, which classifies 6-methyl nicotine as less toxic under the European Union's Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP) Regulation.</p><p>Aroma King said 6-methyl nicotine was self-classified by its supplier. It declined to say who supplies it with the chemical.</p><p>Four Chinese companies hold patents in China related to the production of 6-methyl nicotine, including Zinwi Biotech, a company that makes the liquid used in vapes.</p><p>Zinwi Biotech confirmed it is researching 6-methyl nicotine but did not answer further questions, including on whether it has sold any 6-methyl nicotine so far. Reuters was unable to find contact details for the other firms.</p>", "symbols": ["BTI", "MO", "PM", "XXII"], "source": "benzinga"}

But the shares have finally found new life, rising 24% in this year&rsquo;s first quarter on a bigger rally for offshore-traded China stocks. Now, the company&rsquo;s impressive first-quarter results are reinforcing that sentiment, showing the travel rebound continues even as demand has lost some steam with China&rsquo;s slowing economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tripcom-group-limited-reports-unaudited-first-quarter-of-2024-financial-results-302150007.html\">first-quarter results</a>&nbsp;announced last week showed its net profit zoomed ahead by 27.8% year-on-year to 4.3 billion yuan ($599 million), while its adjusted EBITDA cruised higher by an even bigger 42.9% to 4 billion yuan, with adjusted EBITDA margin climbing 2 percentage points to 33%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trip.com&rsquo;s quarterly revenue rose 29% to 11.9 billion yuan year-on-year, mainly driven by strong demand during a quarter that&rsquo;s typically a popular travel season in China due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Transport ticketing accounted for the biggest share of the total, increasing by 20% year-on-year to 5 billion yuan. Accommodation booking revenue came in second with even stronger 29% year-on-year growth to 4.5 billion yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Policy Boost</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Chairman James Liang said China has seen a remarkable jump in both domestic and outbound travel lately due to a combination of factors, including the company&rsquo;s own efforts to improve its products, together with strong growth of its overseas business, a more stable supply of travel products and further relaxation of visa rules for foreigners visiting China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the upbeat report, the results failed to excite investors, with Trip.com&rsquo;s stock falling 2% to HK$430.80 the day after the announcement. Still, investment banks are positive on the company. Minsheng Securities was full of praise, especially for the jump of more than 20% in Trip.com&rsquo;s hotel and air ticket booking revenue, which lifted the company&rsquo;s holiday travel-related revenue above pre-pandemic levels from 2019. Outbound hotel and air ticket bookings were especially noteworthy, doubling year-on-year, with the Lunar New Year bookings also returning to 2019 pre-pandemic strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minsheng also pointed out that Trip.com&rsquo;s overseas operation grew about 80% in the latest quarter in total revenue terms. It added it has great faith in the company&rsquo;s future business prospects thanks partly to policy tailwind as China grants visa-free entry to citizens from a growing number of countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trip.com has many competitors in China, including&nbsp;<strong>Alibaba&rsquo;s</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BABA#NYSE\">BABA</a>) Fliggy,&nbsp;<strong>Tongcheng Travel</strong>&nbsp;(0780.HK) and&nbsp;<strong>Meituan</strong>&nbsp;(3690.HK). Still, it has a commanding lead in the sector, thanks partly to its status as one of the industry&rsquo;s oldest players. The 2023 Report on the Development of China&rsquo;s Outbound Travel from Fastdata showed that Trip.com&rsquo;s platform controlled 54.7% of China&rsquo;s outbound travel market, or double Fliggy&rsquo;s 27.1% and five times number-three player Tongcheng at 11.5%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trip.com has maintained its leading position in part by using a multi-brand strategy. That includes its dedicated Mainland travel platform, Ctrip.com, with 150 million monthly active users, as well as its more youth-oriented Qunar brand with 56 million monthly active users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clear positioning of its brands, coupled with relative ease of use for its websites and mobile apps, have helped Trip.com win strong customer loyalty, especially among big spenders in more affluent larger cities. The company said last July its users in new first-tier cities accounted for 44% of its total base, including more than 12 million platinum-level members with annual spending of more than 20,000 yuan on the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By comparison, Tongcheng relies heavily on its position as the preferred travel agent for WeChat, whose owner Tencent is a major Tongcheng shareholder, and targets lower-spending consumers in smaller cites. Those differences were on display Tongcheng&rsquo;s latest report, which was less upbeat than Trip.com&rsquo;s. Tongcheng reported a 397 million yuan profit for the quarter, up just 5% year-on-year, while its adjusted EBITDA margin fell 7.1 percentage points year-on-year to 21.2%. Its shares fell 12.8% the day after the results were announced.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Overseas Expansion</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Trip.com is the clear king of the hill in China, and it&rsquo;s trying to replicate some of that success overseas. It embarked on a global shopping spree in 2016, picking up trophy acquisitions including Skyscanner that year for 1.4 billion pounds ($1.8 billion). Founded in 2003, Skyscanner is one of the leading airfare comparison sites in Europe and the U.S. and was one of the 10 most-downloaded global online travel platforms in 2022 with 100 million monthly active users (MAUs) in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company also acquired its English-language namesake Trip.com, a U.S.-based social travel network, in November 2017, and built it into the overseas version of its business, focusing on the Asia-Pacific market. At the same time, it leveraged Skyscanner&rsquo;s strong traffic to improve its competitiveness in Europe. China Merchants Securities believes that the company&rsquo;s further overseas expansion, taking advantage of synergies forged between Trip.com and Skyscanner, can become a new revenue driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trip.com has also seized on the recent popularity of AI large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to join hands with one of China&rsquo;s leading players in the space,&nbsp;<strong>Baidu&rsquo;s</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BIDU#NASDAQ\">BIDU</a>) Ernie Bot. The pair are now working on an &ldquo;AI+ travel&rdquo; strategy, aiming to use AI to empower Trip.com&rsquo;s travel business. Applications like using AI assistants to answer user queries could not only provide speedier service, but also help bring down human labor costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Bloomberg data, analysts expect Trip.com&rsquo;s adjusted earnings per share this year to rise 7.7% to 21 yuan, and grow by a further 13.9% next year to 23.9 yuan. The company&rsquo;s projected price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are relatively low at 18.7 and 16.4 times based on earnings projections for this year and next, respectively.

The speculation is that this is related to Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox is a crypto exchange that collapsed.&nbsp;As much as $9B worth of bitcoin may be sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Protection Band And What To Do Now</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp;A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp;</strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Traditional 60/40 Portfolio</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

Gox is a crypto exchange that collapsed.&nbsp;As much as $9B worth of bitcoin may be sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Protection Band And What To Do Now</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp;A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp;</strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Traditional 60/40 Portfolio</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

While having massive amounts of people leave their productive jobs in exchange for government pensions <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/05/38651903/developed-countries-need-immigrants-but-housing-just-isnt-enough-report\">has been deemed an existential risk for modern civilization</a>, the situation <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/03/37445524/historic-90-trillion-wealth-transfer-to-millennials-will-make-them-the-wealthiest-generation-ever-sa\">also entails the largest wealth transfer in history</a>, as baby boomers pass away and leave their wealth to their Gen-X and Millennial offspring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are Boomers Preventing The Invisible Recession?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The short term consequences of this transition on the U.S. economy are still being defined. Some experts anticipate that retiring baby boomers will boost the economy through increased spending in their golden years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has been the dominant narrative for economists looking at spending patterns across age gaps. The average behavior for citizens of advanced economies has been commonly explained by using the \"life-cycle hypothesis.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This hypothesis argues that people try to maintain roughly the same level of consumption throughout their lifetimes. They do this by taking debt when their income is low in their youth, saving when their income is high during middle-age, and diving into their savings (or liquidating investments) in retirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This hypothesis has led economists to believe that the transition of baby boomers into retirement could revitalize the economy. As retirees begin to liquidate billions of dollars in previously stored assets, such as stocks, properties, and other investments, this influx of active capital will be fed into the market to finance their later-life lifestyles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The argument is valid when considering that the baby boomer generation makes up 20% of the U.S. population, but owns 52% of its wealth, according to Fed data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wall Street veteran<strong> Edward Yardeni </strong>recently<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d96e0e1-0067-4a37-abcf-3f288116e04c\">wrote</a> in the Financial Times that the boomer generation and its spending habits are saving the American economy from a recession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the pandemic and the outbreak of war in Europe, a U.S. recession was widely expected but never arrived, making it the \"most widely anticipated recession that didn't happen.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A poll conducted in May revealed that most Americans think they're living in a recession, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/05/38978431/most-americans-think-economy-is-in-recession-under-biden-despite-hard-data-telling-different-story-w\">although the numbers don't tell the same story</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past two years, it's been reasonable to expect a recession given the signals stemming from the U.S. economy. Decades-high inflation leading up to rising interest rates could have naturally resulted in contraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sign of an upcoming recession, says Yardeni, was the inversion of the yield curve for the 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/23/05/32404484/inversion-of-the-yield-curve-prediction-of-the-next-economic-downturn-from-historic-pattern\">which has consistently been a predictive sign of contraction for the past seven recessions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet for Yardeni, the injection of potentially $76 trillion of boomer wealth into the economy has been the principal barricade holding off a recession in the U.S., as baby boomers spend their hard-earned cash in travel, leisure, gastronomy and healthcare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"All these services industries have been expanding their payrolls, thus boosting real incomes, and fuelling more spending,\" writes Yardeni.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read also: </em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com//node/39024782\"><em>Ex-Teacher-Turned-Fund Manager&#8217;s Bold Bet On Rising Rates Propels Turned A Small Pension Fund Into A Top Performer \u2014 Here&#8217;s How</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yet Boomers Are Not Burning Through Their Retirement Funds</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Other commentators have not been as quick to label boomer money as the savior of the story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/05/26/baby-boomers-are-loaded-why-are-they-so-stingy\">piece</a> in The Economist, the unprecedentedly rich boomer generation has also been extraordinarily stingy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the analysis, baby boomers have been preserving, or even trying to grow their capital more than any other generation going into retirement in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All across the developed world, the rates of saving versus spending for people above the age of 65 has increased. In the U.S. by the mid-1990s, \"those aged between 65 and 74 spent 10% more than they took in, but since 2015 people this age have saved about 1% of their income,\" according to the outlet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar examples can be found in countries experiencing an early wave of boomer retirement, like Italy and Japan, which have two of the oldest populations on the planet. More examples across the UK, Canada, Australia, South Korea and Germany show that boomers are clinging to their investments and slowing down the rate of spending, going directly against traditional economic theory and expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasons for this behavior include a desire to leave part of their wealth to struggling younger generations, as well as worries about health-care access following the Covid-19 pandemic, which also changed consumer patterns permanently for the older folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Boomer Spending Trends: </strong>Numbers point in the direction of a bigger desire to bequeath saved-up wealth to generations that are having trouble affording their first home or repaying student loans, with Americans inheriting \"about 50% more each year than they did each year in the 1980s and 1990s.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the life expectancy for current retirees grows, so does their willingness to be prepared to face health-care costs through a longer time frame, thus becoming more cautious with their spending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ownership of equities and real estate has never been higher in U.S. history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis shows that U.S. household net-worth hit its highest historical level during the latest available reading, from December 2023. The same goes for the holding of financial assets like stocks and bonds, as well as non-financial assets like real estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This supports the notion that baby boomers entering retirement are not liquidating their assets as quickly as many economists had anticipated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, retired boomers may be prioritizing passive income from rental properties as well as stock dividends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors looking to replicate this strategy in the stock market could be looking at <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/24/05/39011238/2-reliable-dividend-stocks-and-2-high-yield-alternatives-to-guard-your-portfolio-against-recession\">reliable high-dividend stocks like</a> <strong>Coca-Cola Co</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/KO#NYSE\">KO</a>) and <strong>Verizon Communications Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VZ#NYSE\">VZ</a>), which boasts a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 6.74%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Realty Income Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/O#NYSE\">O</a>) or <strong>AT&amp;T Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/T#NYSE\">T</a>) are also on the list, both with<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/dividends/24/05/38962206/looking-for-a-high-yield-dividend-stock-to-buy-here-are-two-analyst-picks-plus-one-ultra-\"> a yield of over 5% this year and an annual growth rate of over 3%</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/39037894/wall-streets-most-accurate-analysts-say-hold-these-3-health-care-stocks-with-over-4-dividend-yields\">Three health care stocks have had dividend yields above 4% this year</a>, including<strong> Pfizer Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PFE#NYSE\">PFE</a>), <strong>CVS Health Corp </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CVS#NYSE\">CVS</a>) and<strong> Bristol-Myers Squibb Co</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BMY#NYSE\">BMY</a>). <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/JNJ#NYSE\">JNJ</a>) trails behind with a dividend yield of 3.2%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now read: </em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com//node/39008466\"><em>Early Retirement Pitfall: Man Faces Liquidity Crisis Despite $2.4M In 401(K)</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shutterstock image.</em></p>", "symbols": ["BMY", "CVS", "JNJ", "KO", "O", "PFE", "T", "VZ"], "source": "benzinga"}

Debt-holders getting wiped out as well.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A special round of applause for DKI Intern, Andrew Brown, who finished his final exams and has significantly upped his significant contributions to this week&rsquo;s 5 Things. We are excited (but not surprised) to see him progressing so quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ready for a new week of the most important analysis ever? Let&rsquo;s dive in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>DKI Hosts Enrique Abeyta on Talen Energy:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, DKI hosted Enrique Abeyta <a href=\"https://x.com/enriqueabeyta\">@EnriqueAbeyta</a> of HX Research, who <a href=\"https://x.com/Gary_Brode/status/1792949784682303814\">shared his optimistic outlook on Talen Energy $TLNE</a>. Talen, an Independent Power Producer (IPP), owns power generation assets, including the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, the 6th largest nuclear power plant in the U.S. After facing significant challenges, including bankruptcy in 2022, Talen has restructured and launched a datacenter business, which was recently sold to Amazon Web Services (AWS) for $650 million. Talen Energy&#39;s total enterprise value is approximately $7 billion. However, Enrique notes that Talen&rsquo;s Susquehanna plant alone is worth an inflation-adjusted $24 billion, and Southern Company recently completed a similar capacity plant for $30 billion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"talen_energy_stock_chart.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/talen_energy_stock_chart.jpg\" style=\"height:377px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A round of applause to Enrique and HX Research for this performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; DKI has long been bullish on nuclear power and uranium. During the <a href=\"https://x.com/Gary_Brode/status/1792949784682303814\">webinar</a>, Enrique highlighted three positive catalysts for nuclear energy and uranium. First, the substantial energy required to power electric vehicles; second, the reshoring of manufacturing initiated by the Trump administration and has continued; and third, the rapid growth of AI and the increasing demand for data storage facilities. $AMZN is paying above-market rates to $TLNE to secure reliable baseload generation for its recently-purchased datacenter. Uranium and nuclear energy have been a great growth investment and also an excellent inflation hedge. DKI continues to hold uranium as demand is outstripping supply and the dollar loses purchasing power.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Nvidia Delivers the Most Important Earnings Call Ever - for Now:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Nvidia $NVDA stock continues to surge due to incredible revenue growth from its position as the driving force behind the current AI revolution. The conversion of traditional data centers into AI focused data centers, termed &quot;AI Factories&quot; is behind much of that growth. Bolstered by remarkable increases in revenue and stock price, Nvidia has recently announced plans for a 10 to 1 stock split, scheduled to take effect on June 7, 2024, alongside a substantial increase in their quarterly dividend from $.04 to $.10. The dominance of Nvidia&#39;s growth trajectory has not only propelled the company&#39;s success, but has also been the primary driver behind positive S&amp;P 500 returns so far this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"nvidia_earnings.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/nvidia_earnings.jpg\" style=\"height:369px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can debate the valuation, but the fundamental performance has been incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; Nvidia&#39;s $NVDA rapid growth in earnings is driving the stock to new highs and is buoying other companies with its strong performance. Nvidia&#39;s success is well-deserved, but other companies in the sector will need to perform at its level to warrant continued high stock prices. Inflection points in technology has often led to stock bubbles and parts of the AI industry could be the next in line. Nevertheless, Nvidia continues to surpass analysts&#39; estimates and drive innovation in the chip industry. While it&rsquo;s easy to laugh about the constant hype of &ldquo;most important earnings release of all-time&rdquo;, $NVDA has been a massive contributor to equity index returns for the past two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Target $TGT and Watch Sales Disagree on the Economy:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Target&#39;s latest earnings report reveals inflation&#39;s impact on consumers. The retailer showed declines in both food and discretionary sales. Sales didn&#39;t just fall; customer traffic also decreased by 1.9% in Q1. In contrast, UK-based Watches of Switzerland saw its certified pre-owned watch revenue nearly double compared to the previous quarter. This highlights an intriguing disparity: while inflation significantly affects most Americans&#39; discretionary and food spending, its impact on the wealthy appears minimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"target_earnings.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/target_earnings.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a huge decrease, but not the direction they wanted either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; DKI has been highlighting contradictory economic data and saying we have a bifurcated economy. Target&rsquo;s weak sales indicates the consumer is feeling financial pressure from inflation. While sales at Target disappointed, there was growth in the secondhand watch market. Watch sales often indicate a strong economy. The wealthy benefit from higher asset prices while a larger bill at the grocery store is less important to them. So much government spending is done in the name of helping the &ldquo;little guy&rdquo;, but that spending is creating inflation that&rsquo;s crushing their standard of living.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Your Favorite Company Might Not be Telling the Truth About Non-Financial Goals:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, Morgan Stanley published a survey of 300 large companies with revenue exceeding $100MM. Asked about their non-financial goals typically summed up as ESG (environmental, social, and governance), half the companies surveyed said they believe sustainability and social goals are a significant value creation opportunity. Many added that having socially popular policies helped them raise capital or get bank loans making non-financial considerations important to these companies. The results seem clear, but we question whether these companies believe what they say in public surveys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"sustainabilty_-_morgan_stanley_.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/sustainabilty_-_morgan_stanley_.jpg\" style=\"height:444px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do they believe this or are they all talk?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; We question the methodology of only surveying the largest companies. Ford has lost billions pursuing electric vehicle plans that are lauded in the press, but unpopular with customers. As one of the world&rsquo;s largest automakers, Ford can absorb those losses, but smaller companies and family businesses would have had to declare bankruptcy. In addition, when faced with financial challenges, these large companies are less high-minded. Videoconferencing company, Zoom, recently <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91025936/zoom-laid-off-its-dei-team-and-its-not-the-only-company-making-cuts\">laid off its diversity, equity, and inclusion</a> team. Google and Meta (formerly Facebook) <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/google-meta-other-tech-giants-cut-dei-programs-in-2023.html\">cut their DEI programs</a> after promising to grow them. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-esg-hiring-boom-is-starting-to-cool-2dd1e0de\">ESG employment</a> in the US is falling. We draw two conclusions. First, the study was flawed in its methodology. Second, companies talk about non-financial goals, but often take actions that contradict their talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>The Problems in Commercial Real Estate are Getting Worse:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, we&rsquo;ve written about issues in commercial real estate and have noted that many buildings sold for a fraction of the purchase price from last decade. It now appears the situation is deteriorating. Buyers of the highest tranche of debt for 1740 Broadway in Manhattan lost more than 25% of their investment. While seeing a stock go down by 25% isn&rsquo;t unusual, taking losses of that size in the high-quality bond market is a problem. In addition, when the highest-rated debt loses money, that also means the equity and the five subordinate credit tranches were completely wiped out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"office_loan_fall_behind_on_payments.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/office_loan_fall_behind_on_payments.jpg\" style=\"height:380px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will be years before office space demand matches current supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been a lot of analysis this year showing how commercial real estate is less leveraged and the banks are less exposed than we saw with residential collateralized mortgage-backed securities in 2008. The probability that this gets bad enough to crash the banking sector is not zero, but is relatively low. However, pretending things are fine when they&rsquo;re not isn&rsquo;t helpful either. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losses-pile-top-rated-bonds-110000825.html\">A CMBS strategist at Barclays</a> said &ldquo;These losses may be a sign that the commercial real estate market is starting to hit rock bottom&rdquo;. What?! Holders of AAA-rated bonds just got crushed for the first time this cycle. That&rsquo;s not a sign that things are getting better. I&rsquo;ve heard rumors that Washington DC is already planning a bailout for commercial real estate investors. DKI thinks that would be a terrible idea. Capitalism and good asset allocation decisions have to come with the possibility of failure. Bad decisions will and should have uncomfortable outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information contained in this report, and in each of its reports, is believed by Deep Knowledge Investing (&ldquo;DKI&rdquo;) to be accurate and/or derived from sources which it believes to be reliable; however, such information is presented without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.&nbsp; DKI makes no representation as to the completeness, timeliness, accuracy or soundness of the information and opinions contained therein or regarding any results that may be obtained from their use.&nbsp;The information and opinions contained in this report and in each of our reports and all other DKI Services shall not obligate DKI to provide updated or similar information in the future, except to the extent it is required by law to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information we provide in this and in each of our reports, is publicly available.

This could be due to various factors, including perceived growth potential or operational scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> CubeSmart's remarkable performance in 3 months is evident. As of 31 March, 2024, the company achieved an impressive revenue growth rate of <strong>1.9%</strong>. This signifies a substantial increase in the company's top-line earnings.

These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter. </p>\n<p>Beyond their standard evaluations, some analysts contribute predictions for metrics like growth estimates, earnings, and revenue, furnishing investors with additional guidance. Users of analyst ratings should be mindful that this specialized advice is shaped by human perspectives and may be subject to variability.</p>\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</p>", "symbols": ["CUBE"], "source": "benzinga"}

Price to Earnings ratio significantly exceeds the industry average by <b>4.3x</b>, suggesting a premium valuation relative to industry peers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Considering a Price to Book ratio of <b>4.94</b>, which is well below the industry average by <b>0.52x</b>, the stock may be undervalued based on its book value compared to its peers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Price to Sales ratio of <b>12.29</b>, which is <b>1.1x</b> the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The company has a lower Return on Equity (ROE) of <b>0.22%</b>, which is <b>4.65%</b> below the industry average. This indicates potential inefficiency in utilizing equity to generate profits, which could be attributed to various factors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of <b>$900 Million</b> is <b>0.04x</b> below the industry average, suggesting potential lower profitability or financial challenges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The company has lower gross profit of <b>$2.56 Billion</b>, which indicates <b>0.13x</b> below the industry average. This potentially indicates lower revenue after accounting for production costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of <b>-11.27%</b> compared to the industry average of <b>-4.05%</b>, which indicates a challenging sales environment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Debt To Equity Ratio</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/1716994846_0.png\" alt=\"debt to equity\" /></p>\n\n<p>The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio gauges the extent to which a company has financed its operations through debt relative to equity.</p>\n<p>Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.</p>\n<p>When comparing Advanced Micro Devices with its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be observed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Advanced Micro Devices has a stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers, as evidenced by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of <b>0.05</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This suggests that the company has a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be perceived as a positive indicator by investors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<p>The high PE ratio of Advanced Micro Devices indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium for its earnings compared to its peers in the Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment industry. The low PB ratio suggests that the market values the company's assets at a lower price relative to its stock price. With a high PS ratio, Advanced Micro Devices is generating more revenue per share compared to its industry counterparts. On the other hand, the low ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and revenue growth signify that the company may be less efficient in generating profits and growth compared to its industry peers.</p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p>", "symbols": ["AMD"], "source": "benzinga"}

They also explored how current liquidity injections are not labeled as quantitative easing (QE) but have similar effects. Gromen argued that these measures could weaken the dollar, boost economic growth and cap Treasury yields.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/ \"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27091545/Benzinga-conference.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga future of digital assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-267246\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/39063752/shiba-inu-killer-dogwifhat-nets-trader-1-000x-gain-1-5m-cashed-out-5-5m-left-to-go\">&#8216;Shiba Inu Killer&#8217; Dogwifhat Nets Trader 1,000x Gain: $1.5M Cashed Out, $5.5M Left To Go</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These points have substantial implications for crypto investors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Inflation and Liquidity Management:</strong><br>Despite the Fed not labeling it as QE, they are effectively injecting liquidity into the economy. &#8220;It&#8217;s not QE, but the markets react similarly,&#8221; Gromen pointed out. The liquidity boosts assets, including <strong> <strong>Bitcoin</strong> </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) and <strong>Ethereum</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>), as investors seek returns in less inflation-sensitive investments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dollar Weakness:</strong><br>Gromen pointed out the dollar&#8217;s recent weakening trend. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the DXY Index drop about 2.4% since April,&#8221; he said. A weaker dollar often encourages investors to look at alternative assets like cryptocurrencies for better returns.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Political and Economic Strategies:</strong><br>The podcast discussed how political and financial institutions are navigating the high supply of Treasuries. Gromen emphasized, &#8220;They&#8217;re not going to let yields go over 5%.&#8221; This strategy implies continued liquidity support, which can drive crypto prices higher.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Future Liquidity Injections:</strong><br>The experts discussed potential future steps, including Freddie Mac&#8217;s proposal to guarantee second mortgages, potentially injecting significant liquidity into the consumer market. &#8220;This could inject up to $1.8 trillion in liquidity,&#8221; Gromen remarked, indicating further boosts for assets like crypto.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For crypto investors, the key takeaway is that persistent liquidity injections and a weakening dollar could create a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What's Next:</strong>&nbsp;The influence of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin as an institutional asset class</a>&nbsp;is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga's upcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Future of Digital Assets</a>&nbsp;event on Nov. 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/39044228/dogecoin-could-go-to-0-322-if-it-overcomes-this-key-resistance-level-analyst-notes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dogecoin Could Go To $0.322 If It Overcomes This Key Resistance Level, Analyst Notes</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.</em></p>    ", "symbols": ["BTCUSD", "ETHUSD"], "source": "benzinga"}

We are excited (but not surprised) to see him progressing so quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ready for a new week of the most important analysis ever? Let&rsquo;s dive in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>DKI Hosts Enrique Abeyta on Talen Energy:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, DKI hosted Enrique Abeyta <a href=\"https://x.com/enriqueabeyta\">@EnriqueAbeyta</a> of HX Research, who <a href=\"https://x.com/Gary_Brode/status/1792949784682303814\">shared his optimistic outlook on Talen Energy $TLNE</a>. Talen, an Independent Power Producer (IPP), owns power generation assets, including the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, the 6th largest nuclear power plant in the U.S. After facing significant challenges, including bankruptcy in 2022, Talen has restructured and launched a datacenter business, which was recently sold to Amazon Web Services (AWS) for $650 million. Talen Energy&#39;s total enterprise value is approximately $7 billion. However, Enrique notes that Talen&rsquo;s Susquehanna plant alone is worth an inflation-adjusted $24 billion, and Southern Company recently completed a similar capacity plant for $30 billion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"talen_energy_stock_chart.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/talen_energy_stock_chart.jpg\" style=\"height:377px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A round of applause to Enrique and HX Research for this performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; DKI has long been bullish on nuclear power and uranium. During the <a href=\"https://x.com/Gary_Brode/status/1792949784682303814\">webinar</a>, Enrique highlighted three positive catalysts for nuclear energy and uranium. First, the substantial energy required to power electric vehicles; second, the reshoring of manufacturing initiated by the Trump administration and has continued; and third, the rapid growth of AI and the increasing demand for data storage facilities. $AMZN is paying above-market rates to $TLNE to secure reliable baseload generation for its recently-purchased datacenter. Uranium and nuclear energy have been a great growth investment and also an excellent inflation hedge. DKI continues to hold uranium as demand is outstripping supply and the dollar loses purchasing power.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Nvidia Delivers the Most Important Earnings Call Ever - for Now:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Nvidia $NVDA stock continues to surge due to incredible revenue growth from its position as the driving force behind the current AI revolution. The conversion of traditional data centers into AI focused data centers, termed &quot;AI Factories&quot; is behind much of that growth. Bolstered by remarkable increases in revenue and stock price, Nvidia has recently announced plans for a 10 to 1 stock split, scheduled to take effect on June 7, 2024, alongside a substantial increase in their quarterly dividend from $.04 to $.10. The dominance of Nvidia&#39;s growth trajectory has not only propelled the company&#39;s success, but has also been the primary driver behind positive S&amp;P 500 returns so far this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"nvidia_earnings.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/nvidia_earnings.jpg\" style=\"height:369px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can debate the valuation, but the fundamental performance has been incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; Nvidia&#39;s $NVDA rapid growth in earnings is driving the stock to new highs and is buoying other companies with its strong performance. Nvidia&#39;s success is well-deserved, but other companies in the sector will need to perform at its level to warrant continued high stock prices. Inflection points in technology has often led to stock bubbles and parts of the AI industry could be the next in line. Nevertheless, Nvidia continues to surpass analysts&#39; estimates and drive innovation in the chip industry. While it&rsquo;s easy to laugh about the constant hype of &ldquo;most important earnings release of all-time&rdquo;, $NVDA has been a massive contributor to equity index returns for the past two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Target $TGT and Watch Sales Disagree on the Economy:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Target&#39;s latest earnings report reveals inflation&#39;s impact on consumers. The retailer showed declines in both food and discretionary sales. Sales didn&#39;t just fall; customer traffic also decreased by 1.9% in Q1. In contrast, UK-based Watches of Switzerland saw its certified pre-owned watch revenue nearly double compared to the previous quarter. This highlights an intriguing disparity: while inflation significantly affects most Americans&#39; discretionary and food spending, its impact on the wealthy appears minimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"target_earnings.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/target_earnings.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a huge decrease, but not the direction they wanted either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; DKI has been highlighting contradictory economic data and saying we have a bifurcated economy. Target&rsquo;s weak sales indicates the consumer is feeling financial pressure from inflation. While sales at Target disappointed, there was growth in the secondhand watch market. Watch sales often indicate a strong economy. The wealthy benefit from higher asset prices while a larger bill at the grocery store is less important to them. So much government spending is done in the name of helping the &ldquo;little guy&rdquo;, but that spending is creating inflation that&rsquo;s crushing their standard of living.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Your Favorite Company Might Not be Telling the Truth About Non-Financial Goals:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, Morgan Stanley published a survey of 300 large companies with revenue exceeding $100MM. Asked about their non-financial goals typically summed up as ESG (environmental, social, and governance), half the companies surveyed said they believe sustainability and social goals are a significant value creation opportunity. Many added that having socially popular policies helped them raise capital or get bank loans making non-financial considerations important to these companies. The results seem clear, but we question whether these companies believe what they say in public surveys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"sustainabilty_-_morgan_stanley_.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/sustainabilty_-_morgan_stanley_.jpg\" style=\"height:444px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do they believe this or are they all talk?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; We question the methodology of only surveying the largest companies. Ford has lost billions pursuing electric vehicle plans that are lauded in the press, but unpopular with customers. As one of the world&rsquo;s largest automakers, Ford can absorb those losses, but smaller companies and family businesses would have had to declare bankruptcy. In addition, when faced with financial challenges, these large companies are less high-minded. Videoconferencing company, Zoom, recently <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91025936/zoom-laid-off-its-dei-team-and-its-not-the-only-company-making-cuts\">laid off its diversity, equity, and inclusion</a> team. Google and Meta (formerly Facebook) <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/google-meta-other-tech-giants-cut-dei-programs-in-2023.html\">cut their DEI programs</a> after promising to grow them. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-esg-hiring-boom-is-starting-to-cool-2dd1e0de\">ESG employment</a> in the US is falling. We draw two conclusions. First, the study was flawed in its methodology. Second, companies talk about non-financial goals, but often take actions that contradict their talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>The Problems in Commercial Real Estate are Getting Worse:</strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, we&rsquo;ve written about issues in commercial real estate and have noted that many buildings sold for a fraction of the purchase price from last decade. It now appears the situation is deteriorating. Buyers of the highest tranche of debt for 1740 Broadway in Manhattan lost more than 25% of their investment. While seeing a stock go down by 25% isn&rsquo;t unusual, taking losses of that size in the high-quality bond market is a problem. In addition, when the highest-rated debt loses money, that also means the equity and the five subordinate credit tranches were completely wiped out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"office_loan_fall_behind_on_payments.jpg\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/2024/May/29/office_loan_fall_behind_on_payments.jpg\" style=\"height:380px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will be years before office space demand matches current supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DKI Takeaway:&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been a lot of analysis this year showing how commercial real estate is less leveraged and the banks are less exposed than we saw with residential collateralized mortgage-backed securities in 2008. The probability that this gets bad enough to crash the banking sector is not zero, but is relatively low. However, pretending things are fine when they&rsquo;re not isn&rsquo;t helpful either. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losses-pile-top-rated-bonds-110000825.html\">A CMBS strategist at Barclays</a> said &ldquo;These losses may be a sign that the commercial real estate market is starting to hit rock bottom&rdquo;. What?! Holders of AAA-rated bonds just got crushed for the first time this cycle. That&rsquo;s not a sign that things are getting better. I&rsquo;ve heard rumors that Washington DC is already planning a bailout for commercial real estate investors. DKI thinks that would be a terrible idea. Capitalism and good asset allocation decisions have to come with the possibility of failure. Bad decisions will and should have uncomfortable outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information contained in this report, and in each of its reports, is believed by Deep Knowledge Investing (&ldquo;DKI&rdquo;) to be accurate and/or derived from sources which it believes to be reliable; however, such information is presented without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.&nbsp; DKI makes no representation as to the completeness, timeliness, accuracy or soundness of the information and opinions contained therein or regarding any results that may be obtained from their use.&nbsp;The information and opinions contained in this report and in each of our reports and all other DKI Services shall not obligate DKI to provide updated or similar information in the future, except to the extent it is required by law to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information we provide in this and in each of our reports, is publicly available.

On May 20, Bitcoin reached $71,000, marking a significant recovery from its early 2024 lows. The market dynamics show a pattern akin to the 2015-2017 bull market, emphasizing a spot-driven recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin recorded +3.3% (weekly), +7.4% (monthly), and +25.6% (quarterly) gains. Bitcoin ETFs saw a return to positive net flows ($242M/day) after a period of outflows in April, indicating renewed TradFi (traditional finance) demand. Long-term holders have resumed accumulation as prices corrected and consolidated, creating a robust foundation for future price movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum has also displayed resilience, with corrections since the FTX lows being shallower compared to previous cycles. The SEC&#8217;s unexpected approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs has led to a +20% price rally, bolstering market confidence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This development may act as a catalyst to improve the ETH/BTC ratio, which has lagged in performance relative to other crypto assets over the past two years.

The Australian company failed to secure an extension for one of the largest deals in the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mining\">mining</a> sector's recent past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company had already been granted a one-week extension from the initial May 22 deadline, yet Anglo American&#8217;s board remained unconvinced by the three bids presented, the latest of which was a $49.2-billion all-share proposal. Per a Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-29/bhp-abandons-49-billion-bid-after-anglo-holds-firm-on-rejection?srnd=homepage-europe\">report</a> Wednesday, the complex nature of the deal, particularly regarding Anglo's South African assets, proved too much to untangle at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BHP's acquisition attempt focused on Anglo American&#8217;s extensive copper assets in South America, which are increasingly valuable in a world shifting toward electrification and renewable energy. Copper is a crucial component of electrical infrastructure and battery technology, making Anglo's assets in Chile and Peru highly attractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/05/39061149/conocophillips-acquires-marathon-oil-in-all-stock-deal-at-14-7-premium-details\">ConocoPhillips To Acquire Marathon Oil In All-Stock Deal At 14.7% Premium: Details</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>South African Assets A Roadblock: </strong>A significant hurdle in the negotiations has been the fate of Anglo American's South African assets. BHP insisted on spinning off these assets due to their complex regulatory and socio-economic implications. Anglo American&#8217;s South African portfolio includes majority stakes in key mining operations like <strong>Anglo American Platinum</strong> and <strong>Kumba Iron Ore</strong> that are critical to the local economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Africa&#8217;s state-owned <strong>Public Investment Corporation</strong> (PIC), which holds 7.71%, the second-largest stake in Anglo, added a layer of complexity, reflecting the intertwining of business interests and national economic stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Africa&#8217;s economic environment has made this deal particularly complicated. The country is grappling with severe unemployment of 32.9%, widespread infrastructure issues, frequent blackouts and high crime rates. These factors contribute to the risk profile of any large-scale business transaction involving significant South African operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BHP's proposal included commitments to maintain employment levels at Anglo's Johannesburg office and share the costs related to increased employee ownership stakes. Nonetheless, concerns about the economic and regulatory impact of spinning off these assets remained a major sticking point for Anglo&#8217;s board. For the proposed buyout structure, <strong>JPMorgan</strong> estimated the capital outflows from the country to be around&nbsp; $4.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Political Backdrop: </strong>Adding to the uncertainty, Wednesday coincides with the South African general elections, a critical event that could reshape the nation's political landscape. The elections are expected to be highly competitive, with the ruling <strong>African National Congress</strong> at risk of losing its parliamentary majority for the first time in 30 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outcome could have profound implications for the country's economic policies and regulatory environment, further influencing future mergers and acquisitions involving South African assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Last Word: </strong>As per UK regulations, BHP will be barred from making another bid for six months unless a competing offer emerges, putting any immediate acquisition plans on hold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities/24/05/39007586/lithium-market-may-have-turned-a-corner-but-dont-expect-2022-style-rally\">Lithium Market May Have Turned A Corner, But Don't Expect 2022-Style Rally</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Benzinga Mining is the bridge between mining companies and retail investors.

Certain members of the investor group have also agreed to provide BEN with additional capital through the exercise of their warrants if the company is unable to raise an additional $3.25 million by October 31.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand Engagement Network also announced the concurrent appointment of <strong>Paul Chang</strong> to Co-CEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The moves we are announcing today represent a powerful vote of confidence in our strategy from our Board, executive team, and our existing investors,&#8221; said the Chairman of BEN&#8217;s Board of Directors, <strong>Chris Gaertner</strong>. &#8220;This investment will allow BEN to continue to fund its business plan as it seeks to execute on its growth and revenue strategies.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand Engagement Network shares are moving on heavy trading volume following the announcement. According to data from <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/?gspk=YWRhbWVja2VydDUzMzY&amp;gsxid=zBMR4PKmcgBw\">Benzinga Pro</a>, more than 86 million shares have already been traded in the session, compared to the stock&#8217;s 100-day average of less than 110,000 shares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related News: </em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/39044800/whats-going-on-with-fuelcell-energy-stock\"><em>What&#8217;s Going On With FuelCell Energy Stock?</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is BNAI A Good Stock To Buy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An investor can make a few decisions when deciding whether a stock is a good buy. In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages  &#8211; like <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/BNAI\">Brand Engagement Network</a>&#8216;s page for example &#8211; there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are known as capital allocation programs. Brand Engagement Network does not pay a dividend, but obviously has a few ways it can return value to shareholders. Feel free to search Benzinga's <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/dividends\">dividend calendar</a> for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 11.35%, you'll need to buy a share of Nordic American Tankers by June 28, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.12 on July 18, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/BNAI\">Brand Engagement Network</a> will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently. Buyback programs usually serve as a support for share prices, serving as a backstop for demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BNAI Price Action:</strong> According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/?gspk=YWRhbWVja2VydDUzMzY&amp;gsxid=zBMR4PKmcgBw\">Benzinga Pro</a>, Brand Engagement Network shares are up 99% at $2.53 at the time of publication Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Gerd Altmann from Pixabay</em></p>", "symbols": ["BNAI"], "source": "benzinga"}

By comparison, Tether, the largest stablecoin globally, has a market cap exceeding $111 billion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fernandez da Ponte revealed that while PYUSD is primarily active on crypto exchanges and decentralized finance platforms, PayPal aims to expand its usage to retail payments and emerging markets in Latin America, Southeast Asia and Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, PayPal's Xoom service allows customers to send funds abroad using PYUSD-converted dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/ \"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27091545/Benzinga-conference.gif\" alt=\"Benzinga future of digital assets conference\" class=\"wp-image-267246\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/39063040/ripple-donates-additional-25m-to-pro-crypto-super-pac\">Ripple Donates Additional $25M To Pro-Crypto Super PAC</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: However, PayPal&#8217;s journey with stablecoins hasn&#8217;t been entirely smooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company paused its stablecoin initiatives in February 2023 amid regulatory scrutiny and received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fernandez da Ponte said, \"They requested some information.

Data from Technomic shows that about 8% of Starbucks customers waited between 15 and 30 minutes in the last quarter, a significant increase from 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internal frustration over the labor algorithm is growing as the company&#8217;s focus on speed clashes with customer service expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/05/38796481/starbucks-sales-slump-due-to-social-media-boycott-says-analyst\">Starbucks&#8217; Sales Slump Due To Social Media Boycott, Says Analyst</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Laxman Narasimhan</strong>, CEO of Starbucks, has pushed for greater efficiency while encouraging baristas to engage more with customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some employees highlight a countdown clock near drive-thru windows that turns red if baristas exceed 30 seconds per order as a source of stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer&#8217;s negative feedback echoes the concerns of former CEO <strong>Howard Schultz,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/05/38636831/former-ceo-schultz-urges-starbucks-overhaul-amid-sales-slump-report\">emphasized the importance of focusing on the customer experience.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following a disappointing earnings report, Starbucks shares have <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/38597557/starbucks-ceos-dilemma-unfolds-with-stock-performance-falling-sales\">dropped 22% under Narasimhan's leadership</a>. Schultz, the largest individual shareholder, has urged executives to spend time in stores alongside baristas to improve the customer experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is scheduling workers three weeks in advance, considering their preferences for hours and shifts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these changes, Starbucks mandated that employees must work at least 12 hours a week on average each quarter to keep their jobs, which has reduced the number of baristas per location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starbucks believes that baristas working more hours become faster due to increased practice. However, managers report difficulties in covering shifts when workers call out sick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this, Starbucks is testing a new role called the &#8220;play caller&#8221; to alleviate jams by overseeing various tasks and stepping in where needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Starbucks is modifying its drink-making process to save time. For instance, espresso shots will now be prepared first instead of last. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is also introducing new drinks and promotions to boost demand, but this has added to the employees&#8217; workload and often catches managers unprepared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starbucks stock has lost over 20% in the last 12 months.

Though election day is still nearly six months away, the first presidential debate has been scheduled for June 27, unusually early compared to<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/us-election\"> the traditional September timeline. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Goldman Sachs, this earlier-than-usual debate is expected to serve as a key market-moving event, with starting starting to assess potential election outcomes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The June 27 debate is a clear, obvious potential source of market focus, given how those episodes have led to shifts in prediction market probabilities and asset markets in the past,&#8221; stated Goldman Sachs&#8217; analyst Dominic Wilson in a report published Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Asset Market Impacts of Different Election Outcomes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs has outlined potential impacts on asset markets based on various election outcomes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Republican Sweep</strong>: Expect a modest rally in equities, higher yields, and a stronger US Dollar (USD).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Democratic Sweep</strong>: Likely to cause modest equity downside, higher yields, and a weaker USD.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trump with Divided Government</strong>: Anticipate modest equity downside, slightly higher yields, and USD strength.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Biden with Divided Government</strong>: Equities could remain flat, with lower yields and a weaker USD.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These outcomes could be significantly influenced by the scale of fiscal proposals and market reactions to tariff proposals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, other policy changes, such as geopolitical risks and Federal Reserve actions, might further impact asset markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">USD Strength, Tariff Reactions And Equity Outlook</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs highlights that &#8220;the most consistent implications across approaches are for the US Dollar,&#8221; as &#8220;a Trump victory is likely to lead to a stronger dollar&#8221; through several potential channels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expectation of a stronger USD is the most reliable impact of a possible Republican victory, primarily due to responses to tariff risks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering potential tariff reactions in the event of a Trump victory, the trade-weighted dollar, which is broadly tracked by the <strong>Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UUP#NYSE\">UUP</a>), is expected to see a 3.6% increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market response to U.S. tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 serves as a reference point. These episodes generally led to a stronger USD, but also triggered significant equity sell-offs, which in turn lowered bond yields. &#8220;We would expect USD strength against a broader range of major currencies than in the 2018-2019 China tariff episodes,&#8221; noted Wilson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Tariffs have meaningful impacts on short-term inflation paths; they affect profitability and increase uncertainty for companies dependent on imported inputs or those supplying markets where retaliation is a possibility,&#8221; Goldman Sachs wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, a Democratic victory could lead to USD weakness, particularly if tariff risks are well-accounted for ahead of the election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bond yields are more likely to rise in the event of a Republican or Democratic sweep, since the fiscal impulse will be more positive than in scenarios of divided government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For equities, the most challenging scenario might be a &#8220;Trump with divided government&#8221; outcome, where markets react negatively to tariff proposals without compensatory fiscal or tax boosts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the baseline estimates from Goldman Sachs do not strongly advocate for hedging equity exposures, a significant market reaction to tariff risks or renewed focus on debt sustainability amid fiscal expansion could exert more pressure on equities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read now: <em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/39057320/biden-vulnerable-in-2024-presidential-race-new-poll-identifies-key-factor-that-can-dent-his-chances\">Biden &#8216;Vulnerable&#8217; In 2024 Presidential Race: New Poll Identifies Key Factor That Can Dent His Chances</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>", "symbols": ["UUP"], "source": "benzinga"}

As of 31 January, 2024, the company achieved a revenue growth rate of approximately <strong>31.34%</strong>. This indicates a substantial increase in the company's top-line earnings.

Analysts typically arrive at their conclusions by predicting how much money a company will make in the future, usually the upcoming five years, and how risky or predictable that company's revenue streams are.</p>\n<p>Analysts attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish their ratings on stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter or whenever the company has a major update.</p>\n<p>Analysts may enhance their evaluations by incorporating forecasts for metrics like growth estimates, earnings, and revenue, delivering additional guidance to investors. It is vital to acknowledge that, although experts in stocks and sectors, analysts are human and express their opinions when providing insights.</p>\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</p>", "symbols": ["PATH"], "source": "benzinga"}

(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GME#NYSE\">GME</a>), which highlighted the need to reduce counterparty risk and enhance capital efficiency and liquidity in securities transactions, according to Reuters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change mandated by the Security Exchange Commission has wide-reaching implications for investors and financial institutions alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though promising greater convenience, the T+1 settlement system also presents new challenges and requires adjustments to existing processes and strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S, brokerage firm <strong>Charles Schwab</strong> <strong>Corporation</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SCHW#NYSE\">SCHW</a>) shared a statement with Benzinga on how this transition will impact its operations and the trading activities of its clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">US Markets Adopt T+1 Settlement: Schwab&#8217;s Perspective</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The settlement time change offers increased convenience for many investors but also requires more careful attention to certain investment, trading and tax decisions, a Schwab spokesperson told Benzinga. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For example, some investors will want to make sure they own shares by specific dates to participate in proxy votes or annual meetings \u2013 which T+1 will make easier to ensure. On the other hand, because of T+1, clients will have less time to correct any cost basis decisions made in a trade.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once settlement is complete, the cost basis \u2014 comprising the total initial investment, any commissions or fees paid and decisions on dividend and distribution collection \u2014 is set for tax purposes.

It&#39;s only matter of time before there is a flip in fortunes for these beat-up tokens.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A handful of leading so-called &ldquo;Layer 2&rdquo; (or L2) blockchain protocols are not that far away from <strong>Bitcoin&rsquo;s</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) 12-month romp of the market.&nbsp; The question is whether those that have tracked Bitcoin&rsquo;s 144%&nbsp; gains over the last year can continue tracking the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies, or if investors are going to give the laggards their turn next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the top performers over the last year are <strong>Prometeus</strong> (CRYPTO:PROM) &ndash; up 146.52% since last May 28 mid-morning trading &ndash; and <strong>Mantle</strong> (MNT), which is up 112.91%. By comparison, traditional stock investors that just bought the <strong>Invesco QQQ Trust</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/QQQ\" style=\"color:#467886; text-decoration:underline\">QQQ</a>) are up 31.67%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital asset fund managers have watched the Layer 2 theme for at least the last two years. The idea became more commonplace around 2022-23 for Ethereum users, thanks to L2 developer OP Labs. At the time, <strong>Ethereum</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>) founder <strong>Vatalik Buterin</strong> was being hounded by blockchain application developers for its speed, or lack thereof, and its cost. A second layer, if you will, developed by alternative blockchains and even Ethereum itself, would help speed things up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This opened up the alternative blockchain space, led by giants like <strong>Arbitrum</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">ARB</a>), a three billion market cap company now, <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/arbitrum/\">according to CoinMarketCap</a>. ARB is down year-to-date after a total reversal of fortunes versus BTC this past winter. It&#39;s headed south since March, but if the cryptocurrency bull market has any legs, ARB could close that gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The L2 Investment Case</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Layer 2 companies all build from <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/07/28203490/scaling-blockchains-what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-interoperable-chains\" style=\"color:#467886; text-decoration:underline\">three different solutions</a>. The solution options are designed to tackle Layer 1 blockchain problems such as speed, cost, and scalability on the blockchain while being able to maintain an open, decentralized, and secure network.&nbsp; This, of course, is easier said than done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to describe the speed differential between new technologies (blockchains) and old payment systems like Visa, is that Ethereum can process around 7-15 transactions a second. Visa can do around 100,000. Layer 2 technologies are supposed to eventually bring these blockchains up to speed, giving them commercial application. That&rsquo;s been the future play all along for investors, be it venture capitalists funding PROM, or retailers with a crypto trading account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of those three L2 solutions &ndash; ZK-rollups, Optimism rollups, and channels &ndash; ZK-rollups is focused on speed and is the one garnering the most investor attention. Each solution tends to tackle a different problem, and no one has developed a system yet that solves all the concerns of the blockchain community &ndash; be it decentralization versus centralization, or scalability and speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a sense, these techies, all of whom speak a language that sounds like something out of Battlestar Galactica, and who seem to be maybe 20 years ahead of their time, are trying to create a different internet. Today, the transactions on this new internet, aka Web3, are done in cryptocurrencies lay investors have been piling into for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The number of users acquainted with blockchain&#39;s benefits grows each year,&rdquo; said <strong>Iva Wisher</strong>, co-founder and COO of PROM. &ldquo;These L2 solutions are the key to unlocking the full potential of the blockchain ecosystem. They address the existing limits that L1 networks face. By enhancing accessibility, efficiency, and convenience, these solutions pave the way for further adoption and growth.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PROM allows developers to be able to connect both to Ethereum network-compatible blockchains and non-Ethereum ones, such as Bitcoin or <strong>Solana</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/SOL-USD\" style=\"color:#467886; text-decoration:underline\">SOL</a>). This attracts the decentralization aspect of the blockchain developer crowd and mitigates the risk of network downtime. Investors seem to like it this year. Although PROM is down around $50 per coin from its all-time high of $65.86 reached on April 30, 2021, PROM&#39;s first trading day back in 2019 had an initial price of $0.33 and is currently priced a little over $10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ethereum, with its average 12-second block speed, stands out as one of the slowest and most costly around,&rdquo; said <strong>Yves La Rose</strong>, Co-Founder and CEO of <strong>EOS Network Foundation</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eos/usd\">EOS</a>). &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the layer 2 solutions that allow for substantial enhancements in speed and cost-efficiency, because making those improvements directly on the Ethereum main chain would be a highly contentious issue.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>L2 investors tend to buy the coins of the alternative blockchains, even though Ethereum is still the biggest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ETH&rsquo;s first-quarter trading volume dipped under 40%. Analysts have attributed ETH&rsquo;s volume drop during the BTC bull rally to investors following developers to alternative blockchains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Competing chains provide options that resonate with crypto lovers disillusioned with Ethereum&rsquo;s offerings,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Kerr, a crypto investment analyst with BanklessTimes. &ldquo;The team at ETH will look at these numbers as a wake-up call,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March, Buterin announced that one of its L2 solutions, called <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-ecosystem-mindshift-vitalik-buterin\" style=\"color:#467886; text-decoration:underline\">Dencun</a>, was underwhelming. &ldquo;The amount of usage is interestingly low,&rdquo; he <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/222767/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-surprised-l2-usage-dencun\" style=\"color:#467886; text-decoration:underline\">said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all of the blockchain players &ndash; including EOS down 8.9% since last year -- have slipped away from the BTC rally in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But at some point, Bitcoin outperformance will likely flip. The question is whether the laggards like EOS and even L2 solution<strong> Polygon</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/matic/usd\">MATIC</a>), down 19.5%, will reverse course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"contributor-disclaimer\"><em>This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

This cycle, I think we will see PEPE run to $80 billion+ and then BRETT will follow as the SHIB to PEPE,&#8221; he predicted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those considering investing in meme coins, Crash offered strategic advice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Better to go in with size where you know you are gonna win. Most people gamble away all their money on trash hoping to win. BRETT I KNOW is gonna win,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He likened investing in top meme coins on emerging blockchains to early investments in companies like Tesla or Amazon, emphasizing the importance of making confident, sizeable bets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crash concluded with a strong endorsement of BRETT&#8217;s future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m confident in BRETT&#8217;s future as the #1 meme on Base and think that BRETT at 7 cents today is the equivalent to buying <strong>Bitcoin </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) at $700,&#8221; he said, drawing a parallel to the early days of Bitcoin&#8217;s meteoric rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Next</strong>: These insights into BRETT and the evolving meme coin market will be a focal point at Benzinga&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/events/digital-assets/agenda/\">Future of Digital Assets</a> event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will explore the latest trends and the future of digital asset investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read Next: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/39063040/ripple-donates-additional-25m-to-pro-crypto-super-pac\">Ripple Donates Additional $25M To Pro-Crypto Super PAC</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image created using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.</em></p>    ", "symbols": ["BTCUSD", "DOGEUSD", "ETHUSD", "PEPEUSD", "SHIBUSD", "SOLUSD"], "source": "benzinga"}

Ensuring that \"the utilization and the rates and everything else stay in perfect synchrony through a multi-quarter cycle, there's probably going to be some disturbance around that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The announcement sent shockwaves through the health insurance sector, with stocks of Medicaid-focused companies like <strong>Centene Corp. </strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CNC\">(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CNC#NYSE\">CNC</a>), Molina Healthcare Inc.</strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/MOH\"> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MOH#NYSE\">MOH</a>)</a><strong>, Humana Inc.</strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/HUM\"> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/HUM#NYSE\">HUM</a>)</a> and<strong> Elevance Health Inc. </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ELV#NYSE\">ELV</a>) all experiencing significant drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, states were prevented from terminating Medicaid plans, leading to increased enrollments and higher payouts for insurers. However, with terminations resuming last year, insurers are now negotiating with states for higher rates to cover escalating medical costs. Witty&#8217;s comments underscored the challenges ahead as the industry navigates this transition period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/05/39070214/volatility-spooks-investors-as-treasury-yields-dollar-climb-ahead-of-key-economic-releases-whats\">Volatility Spooks Investors As Treasury Yields, Dollar Climb Ahead Of Key Economic Releases: What&#8217;s Driving Markets Wednesday?</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UNH Price Action:</strong> UnitedHealth Group shares are down by 4.54% at $480.66 at the time of writing, according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard?new_user=False&amp;backend=google-oauth2\">Benzinga Pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"537\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/29150316/UNH-1024x537.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-361730\" style=\"width:690px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/29150316/UNH-1024x537.png 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/29150316/UNH-300x157.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/29150316/UNH-768x402.png 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/29150316/UNH.png 1414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy of UnitedHealth Group Inc.</em></p>", "symbols": ["CNC", "ELV", "HUM", "MOH", "UNH"], "source": "benzinga"}

PC support could make it a more versatile investment, appealing to a broader audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This development comes at a crucial time.
