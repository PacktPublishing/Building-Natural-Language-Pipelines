    "- Understand what you ask\n",
    "- Decide what tools it needs\n",
    "- Use those tools to find answers\n",
    "- Give you a helpful response\n",
    "\n",

    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have an agent that can:\n",
    "1. Search the web for current information\n",
    "2. Answer questions using its knowledge\n",
    "3. Run completely locally on your machine with Ollama\n",

    "You just built your first AI agent! Here's what you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Did\n",
    "✅ Created an AI agent with `create_agent()`  \n",
    "✅ Gave it a tool to search the web  \n",
    "✅ Asked questions and got intelligent answers  \n",
    "✅ Saw how the agent decides when to use tools  \n",
    "✅ Had a conversation with memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Happening Behind the Scenes?\n",
    "When you ask a question, the agent:\n",
    "1. **Thinks**: \"Do I know this, or do I need to search?\"\n",
    "2. **Decides**: Uses tools if needed, or answers directly\n",
    "3. **Responds**: Gives you a helpful answer\n",
    "4. **Remembers**: Keeps track of the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try It Yourself!\n",
    "Experiment with different questions:\n",
    "- \"What's the weather in Tokyo today?\" (needs search)\n",
    "- \"What is 15% of 200?\" (can answer directly)\n",
    "- \"Tell me about AI\" then \"What are some examples?\" (uses memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "In the next notebooks, you'll learn:\n",
    "- How agents work under the hood (state graphs)\n",
    "- How to give agents more tools\n",
    "- How to create multi-agent systems"
