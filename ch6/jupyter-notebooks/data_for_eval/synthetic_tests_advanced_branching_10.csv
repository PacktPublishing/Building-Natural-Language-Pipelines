What are the ethical implications and concerns surrounding the use of Meta AI in generative applications?,"['What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\n What is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\n What is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\n Why is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\n']","The rise of Meta AI, like other generative AI tools, has raised several ethical implications and concerns. Critics highlight the potential for AI to reproduce biased information or discriminate against certain social groups, as much of the data used to train AI comes from public material that may reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism. Additionally, there are worries about the accuracy of AI outputs, as generative AI systems are known to 'hallucinate' and assert falsehoods as fact, sometimes inventing sources for inaccurate information. This has led to concerns about the use of AI in educational and workplace settings, where it may be used to summarize texts or assist in writing, potentially enabling cheating or unethical practices. Furthermore, creators in various fields have expressed their discontent, arguing that AI developers often use their work to train systems without consent or compensation, which they view as a significant threat to their livelihoods.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Wut is the significanse of Artificial Intelligense in modern society and how does it impact business processes?,"['This article was published in 2018. To read more recent content from Brookings on Artificial Intelligence, please visit the AI topic page.\nMost people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI). As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.1 A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.\nDespite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIn this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2\nIn order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward:\n- Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users‚Äô personal privacy,\n- invest more government funding in unclassified AI research,\n- promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy,\n- create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations,\n- engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies,\n- regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms,\n- take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms,\n- maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and\n- penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.\n Qualities of artificial intelligence\nAlthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to ‚Äúmachines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.‚Äù3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems ‚Äúmake decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise‚Äù and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.\n']","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that is transforming every walk of life.

This high energy demand is partly due to the powerful computer chips required to run AI programs, which consume substantial amounts of power and water. Additionally, the rise of generative AI services has led to an increase in data centers, which house thousands of computer servers and require large volumes of energy and water for cooling. These environmental concerns are intertwined with ethical implications, as the rapid growth of AI raises worries about its potential to exacerbate existing societal biases and inequalities.

The\nclassifiers are introduced in more detail in Section 5, their exact text is reproduced in Appendix A,\nand our validation procedure is described in Appendix B.\n Sampled From All ChatGPT Users.We uniformly sampled approximately 1.1 million conver-\nsations, and then sampled one message within each conversation, with the following restrictions:\n1. We only include messages from May 2024 to July 2025.\n2. We exclude conversations from users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training.\n3. We exclude users who self-report their age as under 18.\n4. We exclude conversations that users have deleted and from users whose accounts have been\ndeactivated or banned.\n5. We exclude logged-out users, 16 which represented a minority share of ChatGPT users over the\nsample period.\nOur sample is drawn from a table that is itself sampled, where the sampling rate varied over time.\nWe thus adjust our sampling weights to maintain a fixed ratio with aggregate messages sent.\n Sampled From a Subset of ChatGPT Users.We construct two samples of classified messages\nfrom a subset of ChatGPT users (approximately 130,000 users). This sample of users does not include\nany users who opted out of sharing their messages for training, nor does it include users whose self-\nreported age is below 18, nor does it include users who have been banned or deleted their accounts.\nThe first sample contains classifications of 1.58 million messages from this subset of users, sampled\nat the conversation level (a conversation is a series of messages between the user and chatbot). This\nsample is constructed such that the user‚Äôs representation in the data is proportional to overall message\nvolume. The second sample contains messages sent from this subset of users, sampled at the user level\nwith up to six messages from each user in the group.\n16ChatGPT became available to logged-out users in April 2024, i.e., users could use ChatGPT without signing up\nfor an account with an email address. However, messages from logged-out users are only available in our dataset from\nMarch 2025, thus for consistency we drop all messages from logged-out users.\n6\x0cFigure 1:Illustration of Privacy-Preserving Automated Classification Pipeline (Synthetic Example). Mes-\nsages are first stripped of PII via an internal LLM-based tool calledPrivacy Filter. Then they are classified by\nLLM-based automated classifiers, described in detail in Appendices A and B. Humans do not see raw messages\nor PII-scrubbed messages, only the final classifications of messages.\n', '<2-hop>\n\nPrivacy via Automated Classifiers.No one looked at the content of messages while conducting\nanalysis for this paper. All analysis of message content was performed via automated LLM-based\nclassifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed message data (see Figure 1). The messages are first\nscrubbed of PII using an internal LLM-based tool,17 and then classified according to classifiers defined\nover a controlled label space‚Äîthe most precise classifier we use on the message-level data set is the\nO*NET Intermediate Work Activities taxonomy, which we augment to end up with 333 categories.\nWe introduce technical and procedural frictions that prevent accidental access to the underlying text\n(for example, interfaces that do not render message text to researchers).\nOur classifications aim to discern the intent of a given message, and thus we include the prior 10\nmessages in a conversation as context. 18 For an example, see Table 2.\nStand-Alone Message Message with Prior Context\n[user]: ‚Äú10 more‚Äù [user]: ‚Äúgive me 3 cultural activities to do with teens‚Äù\n[assistant]: ‚Äú1. Visit a museum . . . ‚Äù (truncated)\n[user]: ‚Äú10 more‚Äù\nTable 2:Illustration of Context-Augmented Message Classifications (Synthetic Example). The left column\nshows a standalone message to be classified, and the right column shows the prior context included in the\nclassification of the message on the left.\nWe truncate each message to a maximum of 5,000 characters, because long context windows could\ninduce variability in the quality of the classification (Liu et al., 2023). We classify each message\nwith the ‚Äúgpt-5-mini‚Äù model, with the exception ofInteraction Quality,which uses ‚Äúgpt-5,‚Äù using the\nprompts listed in Appendix A.\n17Internal analyses show that the tool,Privacy Filter, has substantial alignment with human judgment.\n']","Privacy protections in the analysis of ChatGPT user messages are implemented through a series of automated classifiers that operate on de-identified and PII-scrubbed message data. No human ever looks at the content of the messages; instead, an internal LLM-based tool called Privacy Filter is used to scrub messages of personally identifiable information (PII) before they are classified. The classifiers categorize messages based on a controlled label space, ensuring that the analysis maintains user privacy while still allowing for insights into message intent. This process includes technical and procedural frictions to prevent accidental access to the underlying text, thereby safeguarding user privacy throughout the analysis.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"What trends can be observed in user cohort analysis regarding ChatGPT query classification, particularly in relation to the growth of non-work-related messages from different user cohorts over time?","['<1-hop>\n\nThe yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over\n2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been.

For logged-in users, the count is based on distinct\nlogin credentials (email addresses), and one person may have multiple accounts. For logged-out users, the count is based\non distinct browser cookies; this would double-count people if someone returns to ChatGPT after clearing their cookies,\nor if they access ChatGPT with two different devices in the same week.\n10\x0cFigure 4:Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of\nthe requesting user.

Each line rep-\nresents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that\nearlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within\nevery cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,\nand (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.\n 5 How ChatGPT is Used\nWe next report on thecontentof ChatGPT conversations using a variety of different taxonomies. For\neach taxonomy we describe a ‚Äúprompt‚Äù which defines a set of categories, and then apply an LLM\nto map each message to a category. Our categories often apply to the user‚Äôsintention, rather than\nthe text of the conversation, and as such we never directly observe the ground truth. Nevertheless\nthe classifier results can be interpreted as the best-guess inferences that a human would make: the\nguesses from the LLM correlate highly with human guesses from the same prompt, and we get similar\nqualitative results when the prompt includes a third category for ‚Äúuncertain.‚Äù\n11\x0cFigure 5:Daily messages sent per weekly active user, split by sign-up cohort.

The critical part of the prompt is as follows: 21\nDoes the last user message of this conversation transcript seem likely to be related to doing\nsome work/employment? Answer with one of the following:\n(1) likely part of work (e.g., ‚Äúrewrite this HR complaint‚Äù)\n(0) likely not part of work (e.g., ‚Äúdoes ice reduce pimples?‚Äù)\nTable 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however\nnon-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which\nclimbed to 73% by June 2025.\nFigure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-\nsive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work\nuse has increased.

Specifically, the analysis indicates that earlier sign-ups consistently exhibit higher usage, while all cohorts have shown growth in usage due to improvements in model capabilities and users discovering new applications for existing features. In terms of query classification, a significant trend is observed in the share of messages related to work versus non-work. Between June 2024 and June 2025, non-work-related messages grew faster than work-related ones, with the share of non-work messages increasing from 53% to 73%. This trend is consistent across different cohorts, indicating that as new users join, the proportion of non-work-related queries continues to rise, reflecting a shift in user intent and engagement with ChatGPT.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"What are the environmental concerns related to artificial intelligence, and how do they connect to the energy consumption of AI systems?","['<1-hop>\n\nWhat is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\n What is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\n What is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\n Why is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\n', '<2-hop>\n\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\n Are there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU\'s Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections. It bans some AI use altogether.\nGenerative AI developers in China are required to safeguard citizens\' data, and promote transparency and accuracy of information. But they are also bound by the country\'s strict censorship laws.\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the government ""will test and understand AI before we regulate it"".\nBoth the UK and US have AI Safety Institutes that aim to identify risks and evaluate advanced AI models.\nIn 2024 the two countries signed an agreement to collaborate on developing ""robust"" AI testing methods.\nHowever, in February 2025, neither country signed an international AI declaration which pledged an open, inclusive and sustainable approach to the technology.\nSeveral countries including the UK are also clamping down on use of AI systems to create deepfake nude imagery and child sexual abuse material.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world\'s top tech stories and trends.

Some researchers estimate that the AI industry could soon consume as much energy as the Netherlands. The creation of powerful computer chips necessary for running AI programs requires substantial amounts of power and water. Additionally, the demand for generative AI services has led to an increase in the number of data centers, which house thousands of computer servers and use large volumes of energy and water for cooling. This situation raises fears that AI could exacerbate existing water supply issues, particularly in regions already facing drought, as highlighted by Google's reconsideration of a data center proposal in Chile.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
