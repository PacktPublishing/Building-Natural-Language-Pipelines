"How is Amazon utilizing AI technology in its products and services, and what are the ethical concerns surrounding its use?","['What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\n What is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\n What is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\n Why is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\n']","Amazon's AI technology is prominently featured in its voice-controlled virtual assistant, Alexa, which utilizes AI to process data and respond to user commands. However, the rise of AI technologies, including those used by Amazon, has raised ethical concerns regarding data use, potential biases in AI systems, and the implications of AI's rapid growth on employment and societal inequality.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"What percentage of ChatGPT queries related to paid work was identified using an LLM classifier, and how did the growth of non-work-related messages compare between June 2024 and June 2025?","['<1-hop>\n\n5.1 What share of ChatGPT queries are related to paid work?\nWe label each user message in our dataset based on whether it appears to be related to work, using\nan LLM classifier. The critical part of the prompt is as follows: 21\nDoes the last user message of this conversation transcript seem likely to be related to doing\nsome work/employment? Answer with one of the following:\n(1) likely part of work (e.g., “rewrite this HR complaint”)\n(0) likely not part of work (e.g., “does ice reduce pimples?”)\nTable 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however\nnon-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which\nclimbed to 73% by June 2025.\nFigure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-\nsive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work\nuse has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest\ncohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.\n21See Appendix A for the full prompt, see Appendix B for validation.\n12\x0cFigure 6:The solid black line represents the probability that a messages on a given day is not related to\nwork, as determined by an automated classifier. Values are averaged over a 28-day lagging window. The\ndotted orange line shows the same calculation, but conditioned on messages being from users who first used\nChatGPT during or before Q2 of 2024. The remaining lines are defined similarly for successive quarters, with\ncoloring cooling for more recent cohorts. Counts are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million\nsampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total\nmessage volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n']","The LLM classifier identified that 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which increased to 73% by June 2025. This indicates that non-work-related messages grew faster than work-related queries during that period.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
