    "4. **Compare performance** systematically\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Each RAG SuperComponent has **separate model instances** (not shared)\n",
    "2. Test thoroughly for race conditions\n",
    "3. Monitor for embedding model conflicts\n",

    "**Alternative Approaches:**\n",

    "# Option 2: Use a connection pool pattern with multiple RAG instances\n",
    "# Option 3: Implement proper locking mechanisms (reduces concurrency benefits)\n",
