    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a **systematic evaluation workflow** for comparing two RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approaches using **Haystack custom components**. We'll create a reproducible pipeline to:\n",

    "1. **Load evaluation datasets** from CSV files\n",
    "2. **Process queries** through both Naive and Hybrid RAG SuperComponents \n",
    "3. **Generate comprehensive metrics** using the RAGAS framework\n",
    "4. **Compare performance** systematically\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand how to:\n",
    "- Create reusable evaluation components for RAG systems\n",
    "- Build scalable pipelines for systematic RAG comparison\n",
    "- Interpret RAGAS metrics in comparative context\n",
