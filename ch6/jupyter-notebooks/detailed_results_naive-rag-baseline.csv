What are the ethical implications and concerns surrounding the use of Meta AI in generative applications?,"['What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\nWhat is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\nWhat is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\nWhy is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\nAre there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU\'s Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections. It bans some AI use altogether.\nGenerative AI developers in China are required to safeguard citizens\' data, and promote transparency and accuracy of information. But they are also bound by the country\'s strict censorship laws.\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the government ""will test and understand AI before we regulate it"".\nBoth the UK and US have AI Safety Institutes that aim to identify risks and evaluate advanced AI models.\nIn 2024 the two countries signed an agreement to collaborate on developing ""robust"" AI testing methods.\nHowever, in February 2025, neither country signed an international AI declaration which pledged an open, inclusive and sustainable approach to the technology.\nSeveral countries including the UK are also clamping down on use of AI systems to create deepfake nude imagery and child sexual abuse material.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world\'s top tech stories and trends.

To read more recent content from Brookings on Artificial Intelligence, please visit the AI topic page.\nMost people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI). As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.1 A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.\nDespite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIn this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2\nIn order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward:\n- Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users’ personal privacy,\n- invest more government funding in unclassified AI research,\n- promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy,\n- create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations,\n- engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies,\n- regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms,\n- take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms,\n- maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and\n- penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.\nQualities of artificial intelligence\nAlthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.\nIntentionality\nArtificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data. They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses. Using sensors, digital data, or remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those data. With massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, and analytic techniques, they are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decisionmaking.\nArtificial intelligence is already altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIntelligence\nAI generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics.5 Machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends. If it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues. All that is required are data that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern useful patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.\nAdaptability\nAI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. In the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.\nApplications in diverse sectors\nAI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors. This includes fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.6\nOne of the reasons for the growing role of AI is the tremendous opportunities for economic development that it presents. A project undertaken by PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated that “artificial intelligence technologies could increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion, a full 14%, by 2030.”7 That includes advances of $7 trillion in China, $3.7 trillion in North America, $1.8 trillion in Northern Europe, $1.2 trillion for Africa and Oceania, $0.9 trillion in the rest of Asia outside of China, $0.7 trillion in Southern Europe, and $0.5 trillion in Latin America. China is making rapid strides because it has set a national goal of investing $150 billion in AI and becoming the global leader in this area by 2030.\nMeanwhile, a McKinsey Global Institute study of China found that “AI-led automation can give the Chinese economy a productivity injection that would add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth annually, depending on the speed of adoption.”8 Although its authors found that China currently lags the United States and the United Kingdom in AI deployment, the sheer size of its AI market gives that country tremendous opportunities for pilot testing and future development.\nFinance\nInvestments in financial AI in the United States tripled between 2013 and 2014 to a total of $12.2 billion.9 According to observers in that sector, “Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check.”10 In addition, there are so-called robo-advisers that “create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers.”11 These advances are designed to take the emotion out of investing and undertake decisions based on analytical considerations, and make these choices in a matter of minutes.\nA prominent example of this is taking place in stock exchanges, where high-frequency trading by machines has replaced much of human decisionmaking. People submit buy and sell orders, and computers match them in the blink of an eye without human intervention. Machines can spot trading inefficiencies or market differentials on a very small scale and execute trades that make money according to investor instructions.12 Powered in some places by advanced computing, these tools have much greater capacities for storing information because of their emphasis not on a zero or a one, but on “quantum bits” that can store multiple values in each location.13 That dramatically increases storage capacity and decreases processing times.\nFraud detection represents another way AI is helpful in financial systems. It sometimes is difficult to discern fraudulent activities in large organizations, but AI can identify abnormalities, outliers, or deviant cases requiring additional investigation. That helps managers find problems early in the cycle, before they reach dangerous levels.14\nNational security\nAI plays a substantial role in national defense. Through its Project Maven, the American military is deploying AI “to sift through the massive troves of data and video captured by surveillance and then alert human analysts of patterns or when there is abnormal or suspicious activity.”15 According to Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, the goal of emerging technologies in this area is “to meet our warfighters’ needs and to increase [the] speed and agility [of] technology development and procurement.”16\nArtificial intelligence will accelerate the traditional process of warfare so rapidly that a new term has been coined: hyperwar.\nThe big data analytics associated with AI will profoundly affect intelligence analysis, as massive amounts of data are sifted in near real time—if not eventually in real time—thereby providing commanders and their staffs a level of intelligence analysis and productivity heretofore unseen. Command and control will similarly be affected as human commanders delegate certain routine, and in special circumstances, key decisions to AI platforms, reducing dramatically the time associated with the decision and subsequent action. In the end, warfare is a time competitive process, where the side able to decide the fastest and move most quickly to execution will generally prevail. Indeed, artificially intelligent intelligence systems, tied to AI-assisted command and control systems, can move decision support and decisionmaking to a speed vastly superior to the speeds of the traditional means of waging war. So fast will be this process, especially if coupled to automatic decisions to launch artificially intelligent autonomous weapons systems capable of lethal outcomes, that a new term has been coined specifically to embrace the speed at which war will be waged: hyperwar.\nWhile the ethical and legal debate is raging over whether America will ever wage war with artificially intelligent autonomous lethal systems, the Chinese and Russians are not nearly so mired in this debate, and we should anticipate our need to defend against these systems operating at hyperwar speeds. The challenge in the West of where to position “humans in the loop” in a hyperwar scenario will ultimately dictate the West’s capacity to be competitive in this new form of conflict.17\nJust as AI will profoundly affect the speed of warfare, the proliferation of zero day or zero second cyber threats as well as polymorphic malware will challenge even the most sophisticated signature-based cyber protection. This forces significant improvement to existing cyber defenses. Increasingly, vulnerable systems are migrating, and will need to shift to a layered approach to cybersecurity with cloud-based, cognitive AI platforms. This approach moves the community toward a “thinking” defensive capability that can defend networks through constant training on known threats. This capability includes DNA-level analysis of heretofore unknown code, with the possibility of recognizing and stopping inbound malicious code by recognizing a string component of the file. This is how certain key U.S.-based systems stopped the debilitating “WannaCry” and “Petya” viruses.\nPreparing for hyperwar and defending critical cyber networks must become a high priority because China, Russia, North Korea, and other countries are putting substantial resources into AI. In 2017, China’s State Council issued a plan for the country to “build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion” by 2030.18 As an example of the possibilities, the Chinese search firm Baidu has pioneered a facial recognition application that finds missing people. In addition, cities such as Shenzhen are providing up to $1 million to support AI labs. That country hopes AI will provide security, combat terrorism, and improve speech recognition programs.19 The dual-use nature of many AI algorithms will mean AI research focused on one sector of society can be rapidly modified for use in the security sector as well.20\nHealth care\nAI tools are helping designers improve computational sophistication in health care. For example, Merantix is a German company that applies deep learning to medical issues. It has an application in medical imaging that “detects lymph nodes in the human body in Computer Tomography (CT) images.”21 According to its developers, the key is labeling the nodes and identifying small lesions or growths that could be problematic. Humans can do this, but radiologists charge $100 per hour and may be able to carefully read only four images an hour. If there were 10,000 images, the cost of this process would be $250,000, which is prohibitively expensive if done by humans.\nWhat deep learning can do in this situation is train computers on data sets to learn what a normal-looking versus an irregular-appearing lymph node is. After doing that through imaging exercises and honing the accuracy of the labeling, radiological imaging specialists can apply this knowledge to actual patients and determine the extent to which someone is at risk of cancerous lymph nodes. Since only a few are likely to test positive, it is a matter of identifying the unhealthy versus healthy node.\nAI has been applied to congestive heart failure as well, an illness that afflicts 10 percent of senior citizens and costs $35 billion each year in the United States. AI tools are helpful because they “predict in advance potential challenges ahead and allocate resources to patient education, sensing, and proactive interventions that keep patients out of the hospital.”22\nCriminal justice\nAI is being deployed in the criminal justice area. The city of Chicago has developed an AI-driven “Strategic Subject List” that analyzes people who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators. It ranks 400,000 people on a scale of 0 to 500, using items such as age, criminal activity, victimization, drug arrest records, and gang affiliation. In looking at the data, analysts found that youth is a strong predictor of violence, being a shooting victim is associated with becoming a future perpetrator, gang affiliation has little predictive value, and drug arrests are not significantly associated with future criminal activity.23\nJudicial experts claim AI programs reduce human bias in law enforcement and leads to a fairer sentencing system. R Street Institute Associate Caleb Watney writes:\nEmpirically grounded questions of predictive risk analysis play to the strengths of machine learning, automated reasoning and other forms of AI. One machine-learning policy simulation concluded that such programs could be used to cut crime up to 24.8 percent with no change in jailing rates, or reduce jail populations by up to 42 percent with no increase in crime rates.24\nHowever, critics worry that AI algorithms represent “a secret system to punish citizens for crimes they haven’t yet committed. The risk scores have been used numerous times to guide large-scale roundups.”25 The fear is that such tools target people of color unfairly and have not helped Chicago reduce the murder wave that has plagued it in recent years.\nDespite these concerns, other countries are moving ahead with rapid deployment in this area. In China, for example, companies already have “considerable resources and access to voices, faces and other biometric data in vast quantities, which would help them develop their technologies.”26 New technologies make it possible to match images and voices with other types of information, and to use AI on these combined data sets to improve law enforcement and national security. Through its “Sharp Eyes” program, Chinese law enforcement is matching video images, social media activity, online purchases, travel records, and personal identity into a “police cloud.” This integrated database enables authorities to keep track of criminals, potential law-breakers, and terrorists.27 Put differently, China has become the world’s leading AI-powered surveillance state.\nTransportation\nTransportation represents an area where AI and machine learning are producing major innovations. Research by Cameron Kerry and Jack Karsten of the Brookings Institution has found that over $80 billion was invested in autonomous vehicle technology between August 2014 and June 2017. Those investments include applications both for autonomous driving and the core technologies vital to that sector.28\nAutonomous vehicles—cars, trucks, buses, and drone delivery systems—use advanced technological capabilities. Those features include automated vehicle guidance and braking, lane-changing systems, the use of cameras and sensors for collision avoidance, the use of AI to analyze information in real time, and the use of high-performance computing and deep learning systems to adapt to new circumstances through detailed maps.29\nLight detection and ranging systems (LIDARs) and AI are key to navigation and collision avoidance. LIDAR systems combine light and radar instruments. They are mounted on the top of vehicles that use imaging in a 360-degree environment from a radar and light beams to measure the speed and distance of surrounding objects. Along with sensors placed on the front, sides, and back of the vehicle, these instruments provide information that keeps fast-moving cars and trucks in their own lane, helps them avoid other vehicles, applies brakes and steering when needed, and does so instantly so as to avoid accidents.\nAdvanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change. This means that software is the key—not the physical car or truck itself.\nSince these cameras and sensors compile a huge amount of information and need to process it instantly to avoid the car in the next lane, autonomous vehicles require high-performance computing, advanced algorithms, and deep learning systems to adapt to new scenarios. This means that software is the key, not the physical car or truck itself.30 Advanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change.31\nRide-sharing companies are very interested in autonomous vehicles. They see advantages in terms of customer service and labor productivity. All of the major ride-sharing companies are exploring driverless cars. The surge of car-sharing and taxi services—such as Uber and Lyft in the United States, Daimler’s Mytaxi and Hailo service in Great Britain, and Didi Chuxing in China—demonstrate the opportunities of this transportation option. Uber recently signed an agreement to purchase 24,000 autonomous cars from Volvo for its ride-sharing service.32\nHowever, the ride-sharing firm suffered a setback in March 2018 when one of its autonomous vehicles in Arizona hit and killed a pedestrian. Uber and several auto manufacturers immediately suspended testing and launched investigations into what went wrong and how the fatality could have occurred.33 Both industry and consumers want reassurance that the technology is safe and able to deliver on its stated promises. Unless there are persuasive answers, this accident could slow AI advancements in the transportation sector.\nSmart cities\nMetropolitan governments are using AI to improve urban service delivery. For example, according to Kevin Desouza, Rashmi Krishnamurthy, and Gregory Dawson:\nThe Cincinnati Fire Department is using data analytics to optimize medical emergency responses. The new analytics system recommends to the dispatcher an appropriate response to a medical emergency call—whether a patient can be treated on-site or needs to be taken to the hospital—by taking into account several factors, such as the type of call, location, weather, and similar calls.34\nSince it fields 80,000 requests each year, Cincinnati officials are deploying this technology to prioritize responses and determine the best ways to handle emergencies. They see AI as a way to deal with large volumes of data and figure out efficient ways of responding to public requests. Rather than address service issues in an ad hoc manner, authorities are trying to be proactive in how they provide urban services.\nCincinnati is not alone. A number of metropolitan areas are adopting smart city applications that use AI to improve service delivery, environmental planning, resource management, energy utilization, and crime prevention, among other things. For its smart cities index, the magazine Fast Company ranked American locales and found Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City as the top adopters. Seattle, for example, has embraced sustainability and is using AI to manage energy usage and resource management. Boston has launched a “City Hall To Go” that makes sure underserved communities receive needed public services. It also has deployed “cameras and inductive loops to manage traffic and acoustic sensors to identify gun shots.” San Francisco has certified 203 buildings as meeting LEED sustainability standards.35\nThrough these and other means, metropolitan areas are leading the country in the deployment of AI solutions. Indeed, according to a National League of Cities report, 66 percent of American cities are investing in smart city technology. Among the top applications noted in the report are “smart meters for utilities, intelligent traffic signals, e-governance applications, Wi-Fi kiosks, and radio frequency identification sensors in pavement.”36\nPolicy, regulatory, and ethical issues\nThese examples from a variety of sectors demonstrate how AI is transforming many walks of human existence. The increasing penetration of AI and autonomous devices into many aspects of life is altering basic operations and decisionmaking within organizations, and improving efficiency and response times.\nAt the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues. For example, how should we promote data access? How do we guard against biased or unfair data used in algorithms? What types of ethical principles are introduced through software programming, and how transparent should designers be about their choices? What about questions of legal liability in cases where algorithms cause harm?37\nThe increasing penetration of AI into many aspects of life is altering decisionmaking within organizations and improving efficiency. At the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues.\nData access problems\nThe key to getting the most out of AI is having a “data-friendly ecosystem with unified standards and cross-platform sharing.” AI depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought to bear on concrete problems. Having data that are “accessible for exploration” in the research community is a prerequisite for successful AI development.38\nAccording to a McKinsey Global Institute study, nations that promote open data sources and data sharing are the ones most likely to see AI advances. In this regard, the United States has a substantial advantage over China. Global ratings on data openness show that U.S. ranks eighth overall in the world, compared to 93 for China.39\nBut right now, the United States does not have a coherent national data strategy. There are few protocols for promoting research access or platforms that make it possible to gain new insights from proprietary data. It is not always clear who owns data or how much belongs in the public sphere. These uncertainties limit the innovation economy and act as a drag on academic research. In the following section, we outline ways to improve data access for researchers.\nBiases in data and algorithms\nIn some instances, certain AI systems are thought to have enabled discriminatory or biased practices.40 For example, Airbnb has been accused of having homeowners on its platform who discriminate against racial minorities. A research project undertaken by the Harvard Business School found that “Airbnb users with distinctly African American names were roughly 16 percent less likely to be accepted as guests than those with distinctly white names.”41\nRacial issues also come up with facial recognition software. Most such systems operate by comparing a person’s face to a range of faces in a large database. As pointed out by Joy Buolamwini of the Algorithmic Justice League, “If your facial recognition data contains mostly Caucasian faces, that’s what your program will learn to recognize.”42 Unless the databases have access to diverse data, these programs perform poorly when attempting to recognize African-American or Asian-American features.\nMany historical data sets reflect traditional values, which may or may not represent the preferences wanted in a current system. As Buolamwini notes, such an approach risks repeating inequities of the past:\nThe rise of automation and the increased reliance on algorithms for high-stakes decisions such as whether someone get insurance or not, your likelihood to default on a loan or somebody’s risk of recidivism means this is something that needs to be addressed. Even admissions decisions are increasingly automated—what school our children go to and what opportunities they have. We don’t have to bring the structural inequalities of the past into the future we create.43\nAI ethics and transparency\nAlgorithms embed ethical considerations and value choices into program decisions. As such, these systems raise questions concerning the criteria used in automated decisionmaking. Some people want to have a better understanding of how algorithms function and what choices are being made.44\nIn the United States, many urban schools use algorithms for enrollment decisions based on a variety of considerations, such as parent preferences, neighborhood qualities, income level, and demographic background. According to Brookings researcher Jon Valant, the New Orleans–based Bricolage Academy “gives priority to economically disadvantaged applicants for up to 33 percent of available seats. In practice, though, most cities have opted for categories that prioritize siblings of current students, children of school employees, and families that live in school’s broad geographic area.”45 Enrollment choices can be expected to be very different when considerations of this sort come into play.\nDepending on how AI systems are set up, they can facilitate the redlining of mortgage applications, help people discriminate against individuals they don’t like, or help screen or build rosters of individuals based on unfair criteria. The types of considerations that go into programming decisions matter a lot in terms of how the systems operate and how they affect customers.46\nFor these reasons, the EU is implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. The rules specify that people have “the right to opt out of personally tailored ads” and “can contest ‘legal or similarly significant’ decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention” in the form of an explanation of how the algorithm generated a particular outcome. Each guideline is designed to ensure the protection of personal data and provide individuals with information on how the “black box” operates.47\nLegal liability\nThere are questions concerning the legal liability of AI systems. If there are harms or infractions (or fatalities in the case of driverless cars), the operators of the algorithm likely will fall under product liability rules. A body of case law has shown that the situation’s facts and circumstances determine liability and influence the kind of penalties that are imposed. Those can range from civil fines to imprisonment for major harms.48 The Uber-related fatality in Arizona will be an important test case for legal liability. The state actively recruited Uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company considerable latitude in terms of road testing. It remains to be seen if there will be lawsuits in this case and who is sued: the human backup driver, the state of Arizona, the Phoenix suburb where the accident took place, Uber, software developers, or the auto manufacturer. Given the multiple people and organizations involved in the road testing, there are many legal questions to be resolved.\nIn non-transportation areas, digital platforms often have limited liability for what happens on their sites. For example, in the case of Airbnb, the firm “requires that people agree to waive their right to sue, or to join in any class-action lawsuit or class-action arbitration, to use the service.” By demanding that its users sacrifice basic rights, the company limits consumer protections and therefore curtails the ability of people to fight discrimination arising from unfair algorithms.49 But whether the principle of neutral networks holds up in many sectors is yet to be determined on a widespread basis.\nRecommendations\nIn order to balance innovation with basic human values, we propose a number of recommendations for moving forward with AI. This includes improving data access, increasing government investment in AI, promoting AI workforce development, creating a federal advisory committee, engaging with state and local officials to ensure they enact effective policies, regulating broad objectives as opposed to specific algorithms, taking bias seriously as an AI issue, maintaining mechanisms for human control and oversight, and penalizing malicious behavior and promoting cybersecurity.\nImproving data access\nThe United States should develop a data strategy that promotes innovation and consumer protection. Right now, there are no uniform standards in terms of data access, data sharing, or data protection. Almost all the data are proprietary in nature and not shared very broadly with the research community, and this limits innovation and system design. AI requires data to test and improve its learning capacity.50 Without structured and unstructured data sets, it will be nearly impossible to gain the full benefits of artificial intelligence.\nIn general, the research community needs better access to government and business data, although with appropriate safeguards to make sure researchers do not misuse data in the way Cambridge Analytica did with Facebook information. There is a variety of ways researchers could gain data access. ', 'The prompts for each of these automated classifiers (with the\nexception of interaction quality) are available in Appendix A. Values represent the average ratio from May 15,\n2024 through June 26, 2025, where observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given\nday. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n24\x0c6 Who Uses ChatGPT\nIn this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work\ndocuments variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in\nthe U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark\n(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently\nby men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.\nWe make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-\ngraphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for\nselected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have\nchanged over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by\neducation and occupation.\n6.1 Name Analysis\nWe investigate potential variation by gender by classifying a global random sample of over 1.1 million\nChatGPT users’ first names using public aggregated datasets of name-gender associations. We used\nthe World Gender Name Dictionary, and Social Security popular names, as well as datasets of popular\nBrazilian and Latin American names. This methodology is similar to that in (Hofstra et al., 2020)\nand (West et al., 2013). Names that were not in these datasets, or were flagged as ambiguous in the\ndatasets, or had significant disagreement amongst these datasets were classified asUnknown.\nExcludingUnknown, a significant share (around 80%) of the weekly active users (WAU) in the\nfirst few months after ChatGPT was released were by users with typically masculine first names.\nHowever, in the first half of 2025, we see the share of active users with typically feminine and typically\nmasculine names reach near-parity. By June 2025 we observe active users are more likely to have\ntypically feminine names. This suggests that gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have closed substantially\nover time.\nWe also study differences in usage topics. Users with typically female first names are relatively more\nlikely to send messages related toWritingandPractical Guidance. By contrast, users with typically\nmale first names are more likely to use ChatGPT forTechnical Help,Seeking Out Information, and\nMultimedia(e.g., modifying or creating images).\n6.2 Variation by Age\nA subset of users self-report their age when registering for OpenAI. Among those who self-report their\nage, around 46% of the messages in our dataset are accounted for by users 18-25.\nA higher share of messages are work-related for older users. Work-related messages comprised\napproximately 23% of messages for users under age 26, with this share increasing with age. The\none exception is users who self-attest to being 66 years-old or older, with only 16% of their classified\nmessages being work-related. The plot below shows trends in the share of work-related messages by\nage group. ChatGPT usage has become less work-related over time for users of all ages.\n25\x0cFigure 18:Breakdown of weekly active users by typically masculine and typically feminine first names. We\ndraw on a uniform sample of 1.1M ChatGPT accounts, subject to the same user exclusion principles as other\ndatasets we analyze. Note that this is a separate sample than those described in Section 3. First names\nare classified as typically masculine or typically feminine using public aggregated datasets of name-gender\nassociations.\nFigure 19:Difference in share of topic prevalence in messages by users with typically masculine/feminine\nfirst name. We draw on a uniform sample of 1.1M ChatGPT accounts, subject to the same user exclusion\nprinciples as other datasets we analyze. Note that this is a separate sample than those described in Section\n3. First names are classified as typically masculine or typically feminine using public aggregated datasets\nof name-gender associations. Topics are aggregated groupings from a classifier whose prompt we provide in\nAppendix A.\n26\x0cFigure 20:Likelihood that a message is work related, conditioned on self-reported user age. Messages are\nidentified as work related using an automated classifier. As with our other samples (see Section 3), users who\nself-report an age under 18 are excluded from analysis. Values are averaged over a 28 day lagging window.\nShares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024\nthrough June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day.\n6.3 Variation by Country\nWe study global patterns of ChatGPT usage by measuring the proportion of weekly consumer Chat-\nGPT users among the internet enabled population of countries with populations larger than 1 million.\nWe also exclude countries in which ChatGPT is blocked. The figure below plots this proportion in\nMay 2024 and May 2025 by GDP-per-capita deciles: countries are ranked by GDP-per-capita and split\ninto ten deciles, and the x-axis shows each decile’s median GDP-per-capita (in thousands of U.S. dol-\nlars).24 The solid line shows the median share within each decile; the shaded band is the interquartile\nrange (25th–75th percentile) of country values within that decile. Comparing May 2024 to May 2025,\nwe see that the adoption of ChatGPT grew dramatically, but also that there was disproportionate\ngrowth in low to middle-income countries ($10,000–40,000 GDP-per-capita). Overall, we find that\nmany low-to-middle income countries have experienced high growth in ChatGPT adoption.\n6.4 Variation by Education\nWe next analyze results from matching with publicly available datasets.\nFigure 22 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user education. Panel A shows the share of\nmessages that are work-related, for users with less than a bachelor’s degree, exactly a bachelor’s\ndegree, and some graduate education respectively.25 The left-hand side of figure 22 shows unadjusted\ncomparisons, while the right-hand side presents the coefficient on education from a regression of\n24GDP and population data are from the World Bank 2023 estimates.\n25For non-US users, we consider tertiary education to be the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree.\n27\x0cFigure 21:ChatGPT Weekly Active Users as Share of Internet Population vs GDP decile, May 2024 vs May\n2025. Point estimates are medians within each decile. Internet Using Population uses 2023 estimates from the\nWorld Bank. Shaded regions indicate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentile) of country values within\neach GDP decile.\nmessage shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation\ncategories, job seniority, firm size, and industry. We also include 95% confidence intervals for the\nregression-adjusted results.\nEducated users are much more likely to use ChatGPT for work. 37% of messages are work-related\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, compared to 46% for users with exactly a bachelor’s\ndegree and 48% for those with some graduate education. Those differences are cut roughly in half\nafter adjusting for other characteristics, but they are still statistically significant at the less than 1\npercent level. Educated users are more likely to send work-related messages.\nPanel B explores variation by education in user intent.Askingconstitutes about 49% of messages\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, with little variation for more educated users. After\nregression adjustment, we find that users with a graduate degree are about two percentage points\nmore likely to use ChatGPT forAskingmessages, a difference that is statistically significant at the\n5% level. Prior to regression adjustment, the frequency ofDoingmessages is increasing in education.\nHowever, this pattern reverses after adjusting for other characteristics such as occupation. Users with\na graduate degree are about 1.6 percentage points less likely to sendDoingmessages than users with\nless than a bachelor’s degree, and the difference is statistically significant at the 10% level.\nPanel C studies variation by education in the frequency of four different conversation topics –\nPractical Guidance,Seeking Information,Technical Help, andWriting. We find only modest differ-\nences by education across most of these categories. The one exception is that the share of messages\nrelated toWritingis increasing in relation to education.\n28\x0cPanel A.Work Related\nPanel B1.Asking. Panel B2.Doing.\nPanel B3.Expressing.\nFigure 22:(continued on next page)\n29\x0cPanel C1.Writing. Panel C2.Technical Help.\nPanel C3.Seeking Information. Panel C4.Practical Guidance.\nFigure 22:Variation in ChatGPT usage by education. Each plot shows unadjusted vs. regression-adjusted\nestimates, with 95% confidence intervals. We regress each message share on education and occupation, control-\nling for the following covariates: age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, seniority within\nrole, company size, and industry. (To guarantee user privacy, we coarsen all covariates to broad categories and\nprogrammatically enforce that each group has at least 100 members prior to running the regression) We add\nthe coefficients on each education and occupation category to the unadjusted value for the reference category\nand compute 95% confidence intervals using the standard errors from the regression coefficients. The sample\nfor this regression is the approximately 40,000 users of the original 130,000 sample whose publicly available\noccupation was not blank or consisted of strictly special characters (as determined by a classification script).\nShares for each user are calculated by randomly sampling up to six conversations attributed to the user from\nMay 2024 through July 2025.\n30\x0c6.5 Variation by Occupation\nFigure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation. Due to privacy-preserving aggre-\ngation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories – (1) all nonprofessional\noccupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computer-\nrelated occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupa-\ntions; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care. 26 As\nabove, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents\nthe coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the\nname was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size,\nand industry.\nUsers in highly paid professional and technical occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for\nwork.27 Panel A shows that the unadjusted work shares are 57% for computer-related occupations;\n50% for management and business; 48% for engineering and science; 44% for other professional oc-\ncupations; and only 40% for all non-professional occupations. Regression adjustment moves these\nfigures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in\nhighly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages.\nBecause work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related\nmessages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that areAsking\nmessages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely\nto use ChatGPT forAskingrather thanDoing. 28 This is especially true in scientific and technical\noccupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupa-\ntions areAskingmessages, compared to only 32% for non-professional occupations. These differences\nshrink somewhat with regression adjustment, but remain highly statistically significant.\nPanel C presents results by conversation topic.Writingis especially common for users employed\nin management and business occupations, accounting for 52% of all work-related messages. Writing\nis also relatively common in non-professional and other professional occupations like education and\nhealth care, accounting for 50% and 49% of work-related messages respectively.Technical Helpconsti-\ntutes 37% of all work-related messages for users employed in computer-related occupations, compared\nto 16% in engineering and science and only about 8% for all other categories. Regression adjustment\naffects gaps by occupation only modestly. Overall there are stark differences in the distribution of\nconversation topics by user occupation, with work-related messages clearly focused on the core tasks\nin each job (e.g.Writingfor management and business,Technical Helpfor technical occupations).\nWe also present data on the most common Generalized Work Activities (GWAs) associated with\neach broad occupation group, as measured by 2-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes.\nTable 24 presents the frequency ranking of work-related messages in each SOC code of the seven most\ncommon GWAs.29\n26Management and business are SOC2 codes 11 and 13. Computer-related is SOC2 code 15. Engineering and Science\nare SOC2 codes 17 and 19. Other Professional are SOC2 codes 21 to 29. Nonprofessional occupations are SOC codes\n31 to 53.\n27As discussed in Section: Data and Privacy, our dataset only includes users on ChatGPT Consumer plans. Corporate\nusers may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise.\n28Very few work-related messages are classified asExpressing.\n29Appendix D contains a full report of GWA counts broken down by occupation, for both work-related ChatGPT\n31\x0cWe find remarkable similarity across occupations in how ChatGPT is used at work. For example,\nMaking Decisions and Solving Problemsis one of the two most common GWAs in every single oc-\ncupation group where at least two GWAs can be reported. 30 Similarly,Documenting and Recording\nInformationranks in the top four of all occupations.Thinking Creativelyis ranked as the third most\ncommon GWA in 10 of the 13 occupation groups where at least three GWAs can be reported. Even\nthough there are 41 GWAs, the seven most common overall are also the most common within each\noccupation group and are ranked similarly. Not surprisingly,Working with Computersis the most\ncommon GWA in computer-related occupations. In the appendix, we report the full distribution of\nGWA classifications intersected with two-digit SOC codes, as well as the most frequently requested\nGWAs out of the subset of queries which are work-related. Across all occupations, ChatGPT usage\nis broadly focused on seeking information and assistance with decision-making.\nusage and all ChatGPT usage.\n30For legal and food service occupations, we are only able to rank one of the GWAs because of user privacy protections\n- no other GWAs were requested by more than 100 users in that group.\n32\x0cPanel A.Work Related\nPanel B1.Asking.

See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between GWA and two-digit SOC2 codes.\n35\x0c7 Conclusion\nThis paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,\nChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more\nthan 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-\ntion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new\ntechnology is used and who is using it.\nThis is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while\nintroducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans\nduring any part of the work on this paper.\nThis paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%\nof ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related\nqueries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.\nSecond, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing,\nandSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro-\ngrammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages\nrespectively.\nThird,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages\noverall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About\ntwo-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text\nfrom scratch.\nFourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we\ncallAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,\nadvice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process\n(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing).Askingmessages have grown\nfaster thanDoingmessages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that\nmeasures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.\nFifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,\nmore than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages\nsent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially\nfast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly\neducated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related\nmessages and forAskingrather thanDoingmessages at work.\n']","['What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\n What is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\n What is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\n Why is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\n']","The ethical implications and concerns surrounding the use of Meta AI in generative applications include the potential for reproducing biased information and discriminating against social groups. Critics worry that since much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts, it may reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism. Additionally, generative AI systems are known for their tendency to ""hallucinate,"" asserting falsehoods as fact and sometimes inventing sources for inaccurate information. This raises concerns about the credibility and reliability of the content generated by such systems.

Moreover, there are ethical concerns related to the use of creators' works to train AI models without consent or compensation. Many writers, musicians, and artists have voiced their opposition, citing the unjust threat to their livelihoods posed by AI technologies using their intellectual property without proper acknowledgment. The rapid development of generative AI tools has led to significant unease regarding appropriation of creative work and the potential loss of authorial control for artists.","The rise of Meta AI, like other generative AI tools, has raised several ethical implications and concerns. Critics highlight the potential for AI to reproduce biased information or discriminate against certain social groups, as much of the data used to train AI comes from public material that may reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism. Additionally, there are worries about the accuracy of AI outputs, as generative AI systems are known to 'hallucinate' and assert falsehoods as fact, sometimes inventing sources for inaccurate information. This has led to concerns about the use of AI in educational and workplace settings, where it may be used to summarize texts or assist in writing, potentially enabling cheating or unethical practices. Furthermore, creators in various fields have expressed their discontent, arguing that AI developers often use their work to train systems without consent or compensation, which they view as a significant threat to their livelihoods.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.9902485705370022,0.049999999975,0.25

We document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages bu t even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation top\nic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional sear ch engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.\nAaron Chatterji\nDuke University\nFuqua School of Business and OpenAI\nronnie@duke.edu\nThomas Cunningham OpenAI\ntom.cunningham@gmail.com\nDavid J.

By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week\nby 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population. 1 For a new technology,\nthis speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).\nThis paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the\nlargest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ndeveloped over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3\nThe sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial\nintelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou\net al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there\nis limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported\nadoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect\nbias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track\nthe quantity or nature of chatbot conversations.\nTwo recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways\n(Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool\nof users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the\naverage chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that\nusers send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the\ndiffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts.\nFourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education\ncategories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages\nsent by different groups while protecting user privacy.\nOur primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free,\nPlus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025. 5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified\nautomatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work,\nthe topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET\ntask the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us to\nclassify messages without any human seeing them. We give the text of most prompts in Appendix A\nalong with details about how the prompts were validated in Appendix B.6 The classification pipeline is\nprotected by a series of privacy measures, detailed below, to ensure no leakage of sensitive information\nduring the automated analysis. In a secure data clean room, we relate taxonomies of messages to\naggregated employment and education categories.\nTable 1 shows the growth in total message volume for work and non-work usage. Both types of\n1Reuters (2025), Roth (2025)\n2Bick et al. (2024) report that 28% of US adults used ChatGPT in late 2024, higher than any other chatbot.\n3We use the term LLM loosely here and give more details in the following section.\n4Wiggers (2025) reports estimates that in April 2025 ChatGPT was receiving more than 10 times as many visitors\nas either Claude or Copilot.\n5Our sample includes the three consumer plans (Free, Plus, or Pro). OpenAI also offers a variety of other ChatGPT\nplans (Business fka. Teams, Enterprise, Education), which we do not include in our sample.\n6Our classifiers take into account not just the randomly-selected user message, but also a portion of the preceding\nmessages in that conversation.\n1\x0cMonth Non-Work (M)(%)Work (M)(%)Total Messages (M)\nJun 2024 238 53% 213 47% 451\nJun 2025 1,911 73% 716 27% 2,627\nTable 1:ChatGPT daily message counts (millions), broken down by likely work-related or non-work-related.\nTotal daily counts are exact measurements of message volume from all consumer plans. Daily counts of work\nand non-work related messages are estimated by classifying a random sample of conversations from that day.\nSampling is done to exclude users who opt-out of sharing their messages for model training, users who self-\nreport their age as under 18, logged-out users, deleted conversations, and accounts which have been deactivated\nor banned (details available in Section 3). Reported values are 7-day averages (to smooth weekly fluctuation)\nending on the 26th of June 2024 and 26th of June 2025.\nmessages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more\nthan 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its\nimpact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a\nsimilar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to\nchanging usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT\nusers. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to\nuncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least$97 billion\nin 2024 alone in the US.\nWe next report on a classification of messages using a taxonomy developed at OpenAI for un-\nderstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into\nthree broad categories, which we callPractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting.Practical\nGuidanceis the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to\nadvice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation. 7 Seeking Informationincludes searching for\ninformation about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub-\nstitute for web search.Writingincludes the automated production of emails, documents and other\ncommunications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user.\nWritingis the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average\nin June 2025. About two-thirds of allWritingmessages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing,\ncritiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages\nare requests for tutoring or teaching, suggesting that education is a key use case for ChatGPT.\nTwo of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related\nto computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer\nprogramming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025).8 Second, we\nfind the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9%\nof ChatGPT messages are on the topic ofRelationships and Personal Reflectionand 0.4% are related\n7The difference betweenPractical GuidanceandSeeking Informationis that the former is highly customized to the\nuser and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be\nthe same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying\ntimes by age and gender (Seeking Information), or they might ask for a customized workout plan that matches their\ngoals and current level of fitness (Practical Guidance).\n8Handa et al. (2025) report that 37% of conversations are mapped to a “computer and mathematical” occupation\ncategory, and their Figure 12 shows 30% or more of all imputed tasks are programming or IT-related. We believe the\ndiscrepancy is partly due to the difference in types of users between Claude and ChatGPT, additionally Handa et al.\n(2025) only includes queries that ”possibly involve an occupational task”.\n2\x0ctoGames and Role Play. In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates thatTherapy/Companionshipis\nthe most prevalent use case for generative AI. 9\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,\nwe show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,\nand may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active\nusers had typically masculine first names. 10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,\nwith active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that\nnearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps\nhave narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively\nfaster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and\nusers in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is\nseeking, using a simple rubric that we callAsking, Doing,orExpressing. 11 Askingis when the\nuser is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving\nmodels of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and\nSchneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)).Doingis when the user wants to produce some output\nor perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.\n(2003)).Expressingis when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or\naction. We estimate that about 49% of messages areAsking, 40% areDoing, and 11% areExpressing.\nHowever, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified asDoing(e.g., performing\njob tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those areWritingtasks. The relative frequency of writing-\nrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all\nwhite-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by\nemployers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of\ngenerative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs\nsuch as writing and software code.\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network\n(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that\nabout 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,\ndocumenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,\nand thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage\nare highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activitiesGetting\nInformationandMaking Decisions and Solving Problemsare in the top five of message frequency in\nnearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales\noccupations.\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT\nuse cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is\neitherPractical GuidanceorSeeking Information. We also show thatAskingis growing faster than\n9Zao-Sanders (2025) is based on a manual collection and labeling of online resources (Reddit, Quora, online articles),\nand so we believe it likely resulted in an unrepresentative distribution of use cases.\n10Among those with names commonly associated with a particular gender.\n11Appendix A gives the full prompt text and Appendix B gives detail about how the prompts were validated against\npublic conversation data.\n3\x0cDoing, and thatAskingmessages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier\nthat measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.\nHow does ChatGPT provide economic value, and for whom is its value the greatest? We argue that\nChatGPT likely improves worker output by providingdecision support, which is especially important in\nknowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et\nal., 2023). This explains whyAskingis relatively more common for educated users who are employed\nin highly-paid, professional occupations. Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas\n(2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either asco-workersthat produce output or\nasco-pilotsthat give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.\n2 What is ChatGPT?\nHere we give a simplified overview of LLMs and chatbots. For more precise details, refer to the papers\nand system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A\nchatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to\nmaximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.\nIn a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT\nreturns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features\nhave been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external\ndatabases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the\nmost typical interaction.\nSince its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5. 12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and\nto the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).\nAn LLM can be thought of as a function from a string of words to a probability distribution over\nthe set of all possible words (more precisely, “tokens,” which very roughly correspond to words13). The\nfunctions are implemented with deep neural nets, typically with a transformer architecture (Vaswani\net al., 2017), parameterized with billions of model “weights”. We will refer to all of ChatGPT’s models\nas language models, though most can additionally process tokens representing images, audio, or other\nmedia.\nThe weights in an LLM-based chatbot are often trained in two stages, commonly called “pre-\ntraining” and “post-training”. In the first stage (“pre-training”), the LLMs are trained to predict the\nnext word in a string, given the preceding words, over an enormous corpus of text. At that point the\nmodels are purely predictors of the likelihood of the next word given a prior context, and as such they\nhave a relatively narrow application. In the second stage (“post-training”), the models are trained to\nproduce words that comprise “good” responses to some prompt. This stage often consists of a variety\nof different strategies: fine-tuning on a dataset of queries and ideal responses, reinforcement learning\nagainst another model that is trained to grade the quality of a response (Ouyang et al., 2022), or\nreinforcement learning against a function that knows the true response to queries (OpenAI (2024b),\n12For a timeline of model launches, see Appendix C.\n13Tokenization is a way of cutting a string of text into discrete chunks, chosen to be statistically efficient. In many\ntokenization schemes, one token corresponds to roughly three-quarters of an English word.\n4\x0cLambert et al. (2024)). This second stage also typically includes a number of “safety” constraints to\navoid certain classes of response, especially those which are deemed harmful or dangerous (OpenAI,\n2025a).\nThis two-stage process has a common statistical interpretation: the first stage teaches the model a\nlatent representation of the world; the second stage fits a function using that representation (Bengio\net al., 2014). Pre-training the model to predict the next word effectively teaches the model a low-\ndimensional representation of text, representing only the key semantic features, and therefore rendering\nthe prompt-response problem tractable with a reasonable set of training examples.\nTwo common ways of evaluating chatbots are with benchmarks (batteries of questions with known\nanswers, e.g. Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (Hendrycks et al., 2021)) and\ncomparisons of human preferences over two alternative responses to the same message (e.g. Chatbot\nArena (Chiang et al., 2024)).\n3 Data and Privacy\nIn this section, we describe the data used in the paper and the privacy safeguards we implemented. No\nmember of the research team ever saw the content of user messages, and all analyses were conducted\nin accordance with OpenAI’s Privacy Policy (OpenAI, 2025c).\nThe analysis in this paper is based on the following datasets:\n1.Growth:total daily message volumes from consumer ChatGPT users between November 2022\nand September 2025, along with basic self-reported demographic information. This dataset is\nprimarily used in Section 4.\n2.Classified messages:messages classified into coarse categories.\n•Sampled from all ChatGPT users:a random sample of approximately one million de-\nidentified messages from logged-in consumer ChatGPT users between May 2024 and June\n2025.14 This dataset is primarily used in Section 5.\n•Sampled from a subset of ChatGPT users:two random samples of messages sent\nbetween May 2024 and July 2025 by a subset of consumer ChatGPT users (one sample at\nthe conversation level, one sample at the user level). 15 These datasets are primarily used\nin Section 6.\n3.Employment:aggregated employment and education categories based on publicly available\ndata for a subset of consumer ChatGPT users. This data is only used in Section 6.\nWe describe the contents of each dataset, the sampling procedures that produced them, and the\nprivacy protections we implemented in constructing and employing them in analysis.\n3.1 Growth Dataset\nWe compiled a dataset covering all usage on consumer ChatGPT Plans (Free, Plus, Pro) since Chat-\nGPT’s launch in November 2022. We exclude users on non-consumer plans (Business f.k.a. Teams,\n14The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and June 26, 2025.\n15The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and July 31, 2025.\n5\x0cEnterprise, Education).\nFor each user and day, this dataset reports the total number of messages sent by the user on that\nday. It also reports, for each message, de-identified user metadata, including the timestamp of their\nfirst interaction with ChatGPT, the country from which their account is registered, their subscription\nplan on each day, and their self-reported age (reported in coarse 5–7-year buckets to protect user\nprivacy).\n3.2 Classified Messages\nTo understand usage while preserving user privacy, we construct message-level datasets without any\nhuman ever reading the contents of a message. See Figure 1 for an overview of the privacy-preserving\nclassification pipeline. Messages are categorized according to 5 different LLM-based classifiers. The\nclassifiers are introduced in more detail in Section 5, their exact text is reproduced in Appendix A,\nand our validation procedure is described in Appendix B.\nSampled From All ChatGPT Users.We uniformly sampled approximately 1.1 million conver-\nsations, and then sampled one message within each conversation, with the following restrictions:\n1. We only include messages from May 2024 to July 2025.\n2. We exclude conversations from users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training.\n', 'What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\nWhat is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\nWhat is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\nWhy is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\nAre there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU\'s Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections. It bans some AI use altogether.\nGenerative AI developers in China are required to safeguard citizens\' data, and promote transparency and accuracy of information. But they are also bound by the country\'s strict censorship laws.\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the government ""will test and understand AI before we regulate it"".\nBoth the UK and US have AI Safety Institutes that aim to identify risks and evaluate advanced AI models.\nIn 2024 the two countries signed an agreement to collaborate on developing ""robust"" AI testing methods.\nHowever, in February 2025, neither country signed an international AI declaration which pledged an open, inclusive and sustainable approach to the technology.\nSeveral countries including the UK are also clamping down on use of AI systems to create deepfake nude imagery and child sexual abuse material.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world\'s top tech stories and trends.

Values represent the average ratio from May 15,\n2024 through June 26, 2025, where observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given\nday. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n24\x0c6 Who Uses ChatGPT\nIn this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work\ndocuments variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in\nthe U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark\n(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently\nby men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.\nWe make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-\ngraphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for\nselected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have\nchanged over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by\neducation and occupation.\n6.1 Name Analysis\nWe investigate potential variation by gender by classifying a global random sample of over 1.1 million\nChatGPT users’ first names using public aggregated datasets of name-gender associations. We used\nthe World Gender Name Dictionary, and Social Security popular names, as well as datasets of popular\nBrazilian and Latin American names. This methodology is similar to that in (Hofstra et al., 2020)\nand (West et al., 2013). Names that were not in these datasets, or were flagged as ambiguous in the\ndatasets, or had significant disagreement amongst these datasets were classified asUnknown.\nExcludingUnknown, a significant share (around 80%) of the weekly active users (WAU) in the\nfirst few months after ChatGPT was released were by users with typically masculine first names.\nHowever, in the first half of 2025, we see the share of active users with typically feminine and typically\nmasculine names reach near-parity. By June 2025 we observe active users are more likely to have\ntypically feminine names. This suggests that gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have closed substantially\nover time.\nWe also study differences in usage topics. Users with typically female first names are relatively more\nlikely to send messages related toWritingandPractical Guidance. By contrast, users with typically\nmale first names are more likely to use ChatGPT forTechnical Help,Seeking Out Information, and\nMultimedia(e.g., modifying or creating images).\n6.2 Variation by Age\nA subset of users self-report their age when registering for OpenAI. Among those who self-report their\nage, around 46% of the messages in our dataset are accounted for by users 18-25.\nA higher share of messages are work-related for older users. Work-related messages comprised\napproximately 23% of messages for users under age 26, with this share increasing with age. The\none exception is users who self-attest to being 66 years-old or older, with only 16% of their classified\nmessages being work-related. The plot below shows trends in the share of work-related messages by\nage group. ChatGPT usage has become less work-related over time for users of all ages.\n25\x0cFigure 18:Breakdown of weekly active users by typically masculine and typically feminine first names. We\ndraw on a uniform sample of 1.1M ChatGPT accounts, subject to the same user exclusion principles as other\ndatasets we analyze. Note that this is a separate sample than those described in Section 3. First names\nare classified as typically masculine or typically feminine using public aggregated datasets of name-gender\nassociations.\nFigure 19:Difference in share of topic prevalence in messages by users with typically masculine/feminine\nfirst name. We draw on a uniform sample of 1.1M ChatGPT accounts, subject to the same user exclusion\nprinciples as other datasets we analyze. Note that this is a separate sample than those described in Section\n3. First names are classified as typically masculine or typically feminine using public aggregated datasets\nof name-gender associations. Topics are aggregated groupings from a classifier whose prompt we provide in\nAppendix A.\n26\x0cFigure 20:Likelihood that a message is work related, conditioned on self-reported user age. Messages are\nidentified as work related using an automated classifier. As with our other samples (see Section 3), users who\nself-report an age under 18 are excluded from analysis. Values are averaged over a 28 day lagging window.\nShares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024\nthrough June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day.\n6.3 Variation by Country\nWe study global patterns of ChatGPT usage by measuring the proportion of weekly consumer Chat-\nGPT users among the internet enabled population of countries with populations larger than 1 million.\nWe also exclude countries in which ChatGPT is blocked. The figure below plots this proportion in\nMay 2024 and May 2025 by GDP-per-capita deciles: countries are ranked by GDP-per-capita and split\ninto ten deciles, and the x-axis shows each decile’s median GDP-per-capita (in thousands of U.S. dol-\nlars).24 The solid line shows the median share within each decile; the shaded band is the interquartile\nrange (25th–75th percentile) of country values within that decile. Comparing May 2024 to May 2025,\nwe see that the adoption of ChatGPT grew dramatically, but also that there was disproportionate\ngrowth in low to middle-income countries ($10,000–40,000 GDP-per-capita). Overall, we find that\nmany low-to-middle income countries have experienced high growth in ChatGPT adoption.\n6.4 Variation by Education\nWe next analyze results from matching with publicly available datasets.\nFigure 22 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user education. Panel A shows the share of\nmessages that are work-related, for users with less than a bachelor’s degree, exactly a bachelor’s\ndegree, and some graduate education respectively.25 The left-hand side of figure 22 shows unadjusted\ncomparisons, while the right-hand side presents the coefficient on education from a regression of\n24GDP and population data are from the World Bank 2023 estimates.\n25For non-US users, we consider tertiary education to be the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree.\n27\x0cFigure 21:ChatGPT Weekly Active Users as Share of Internet Population vs GDP decile, May 2024 vs May\n2025. Point estimates are medians within each decile. Internet Using Population uses 2023 estimates from the\nWorld Bank. Shaded regions indicate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentile) of country values within\neach GDP decile.\nmessage shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation\ncategories, job seniority, firm size, and industry. We also include 95% confidence intervals for the\nregression-adjusted results.\nEducated users are much more likely to use ChatGPT for work. 37% of messages are work-related\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, compared to 46% for users with exactly a bachelor’s\ndegree and 48% for those with some graduate education. Those differences are cut roughly in half\nafter adjusting for other characteristics, but they are still statistically significant at the less than 1\npercent level. Educated users are more likely to send work-related messages.\nPanel B explores variation by education in user intent.Askingconstitutes about 49% of messages\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, with little variation for more educated users. After\nregression adjustment, we find that users with a graduate degree are about two percentage points\nmore likely to use ChatGPT forAskingmessages, a difference that is statistically significant at the\n5% level. Prior to regression adjustment, the frequency ofDoingmessages is increasing in education.\nHowever, this pattern reverses after adjusting for other characteristics such as occupation. Users with\na graduate degree are about 1.6 percentage points less likely to sendDoingmessages than users with\nless than a bachelor’s degree, and the difference is statistically significant at the 10% level.\nPanel C studies variation by education in the frequency of four different conversation topics –\nPractical Guidance,Seeking Information,Technical Help, andWriting. We find only modest differ-\nences by education across most of these categories. The one exception is that the share of messages\nrelated toWritingis increasing in relation to education.\n28\x0cPanel A.Work Related\nPanel B1.Asking. Panel B2.Doing.\nPanel B3.Expressing.\nFigure 22:(continued on next page)\n29\x0cPanel C1.Writing. Panel C2.Technical Help.\nPanel C3.Seeking Information. Panel C4.Practical Guidance.\nFigure 22:Variation in ChatGPT usage by education. Each plot shows unadjusted vs. regression-adjusted\nestimates, with 95% confidence intervals. We regress each message share on education and occupation, control-\nling for the following covariates: age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, seniority within\nrole, company size, and industry. (To guarantee user privacy, we coarsen all covariates to broad categories and\nprogrammatically enforce that each group has at least 100 members prior to running the regression) We add\nthe coefficients on each education and occupation category to the unadjusted value for the reference category\nand compute 95% confidence intervals using the standard errors from the regression coefficients. The sample\nfor this regression is the approximately 40,000 users of the original 130,000 sample whose publicly available\noccupation was not blank or consisted of strictly special characters (as determined by a classification script).\nShares for each user are calculated by randomly sampling up to six conversations attributed to the user from\nMay 2024 through July 2025.\n30\x0c6.5 Variation by Occupation\nFigure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation. Due to privacy-preserving aggre-\ngation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories – (1) all nonprofessional\noccupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computer-\nrelated occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupa-\ntions; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care. 26 As\nabove, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents\nthe coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the\nname was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size,\nand industry.\nUsers in highly paid professional and technical occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for\nwork.27 Panel A shows that the unadjusted work shares are 57% for computer-related occupations;\n50% for management and business; 48% for engineering and science; 44% for other professional oc-\ncupations; and only 40% for all non-professional occupations. Regression adjustment moves these\nfigures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in\nhighly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages.\nBecause work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related\nmessages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that areAsking\nmessages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely\nto use ChatGPT forAskingrather thanDoing. 28 This is especially true in scientific and technical\noccupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupa-\ntions areAskingmessages, compared to only 32% for non-professional occupations. These differences\nshrink somewhat with regression adjustment, but remain highly statistically significant.\nPanel C presents results by conversation topic.Writingis especially common for users employed\nin management and business occupations, accounting for 52% of all work-related messages. Writing\nis also relatively common in non-professional and other professional occupations like education and\nhealth care, accounting for 50% and 49% of work-related messages respectively.Technical Helpconsti-\ntutes 37% of all work-related messages for users employed in computer-related occupations, compared\nto 16% in engineering and science and only about 8% for all other categories. Regression adjustment\naffects gaps by occupation only modestly. Overall there are stark differences in the distribution of\nconversation topics by user occupation, with work-related messages clearly focused on the core tasks\nin each job (e.g.Writingfor management and business,Technical Helpfor technical occupations).\nWe also present data on the most common Generalized Work Activities (GWAs) associated with\neach broad occupation group, as measured by 2-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes.\nTable 24 presents the frequency ranking of work-related messages in each SOC code of the seven most\ncommon GWAs.29\n26Management and business are SOC2 codes 11 and 13. Computer-related is SOC2 code 15. Engineering and Science\nare SOC2 codes 17 and 19. Other Professional are SOC2 codes 21 to 29.

By July 2025,\nChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more\nthan 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-\ntion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new\ntechnology is used and who is using it.\nThis is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while\nintroducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans\nduring any part of the work on this paper.\nThis paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%\nof ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related\nqueries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.\nSecond, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing,\nandSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro-\ngrammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages\nrespectively.\nThird,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages\noverall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About\ntwo-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text\nfrom scratch.\nFourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we\ncallAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,\nadvice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process\n(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing).Askingmessages have grown\nfaster thanDoingmessages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that\nmeasures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.\nFifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,\nmore than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages\nsent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially\nfast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly\neducated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related\nmessages and forAskingrather thanDoingmessages at work.\n']","['How does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\n Are there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU\'s Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections.

Wut is the significanse of Artificial Intelligense in modern society and how does it impact business processes?,"['What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\nWhat is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\nWhat is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\nWhy is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\nAre there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU\'s Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections.

To read more recent content from Brookings on Artificial Intelligence, please visit the AI topic page.\nMost people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI). As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.1 A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.\nDespite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIn this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2\nIn order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward:\n- Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users’ personal privacy,\n- invest more government funding in unclassified AI research,\n- promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy,\n- create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations,\n- engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies,\n- regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms,\n- take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms,\n- maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and\n- penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.\nQualities of artificial intelligence\nAlthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.\nIntentionality\nArtificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data. They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses. Using sensors, digital data, or remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those data. With massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, and analytic techniques, they are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decisionmaking.\nArtificial intelligence is already altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIntelligence\nAI generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics.5 Machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends. If it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues. All that is required are data that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern useful patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.\nAdaptability\nAI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. In the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.\nApplications in diverse sectors\nAI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors. This includes fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.6\nOne of the reasons for the growing role of AI is the tremendous opportunities for economic development that it presents. A project undertaken by PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated that “artificial intelligence technologies could increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion, a full 14%, by 2030.”7 That includes advances of $7 trillion in China, $3.7 trillion in North America, $1.8 trillion in Northern Europe, $1.2 trillion for Africa and Oceania, $0.9 trillion in the rest of Asia outside of China, $0.7 trillion in Southern Europe, and $0.5 trillion in Latin America. China is making rapid strides because it has set a national goal of investing $150 billion in AI and becoming the global leader in this area by 2030.\nMeanwhile, a McKinsey Global Institute study of China found that “AI-led automation can give the Chinese economy a productivity injection that would add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth annually, depending on the speed of adoption.”8 Although its authors found that China currently lags the United States and the United Kingdom in AI deployment, the sheer size of its AI market gives that country tremendous opportunities for pilot testing and future development.\nFinance\nInvestments in financial AI in the United States tripled between 2013 and 2014 to a total of $12.2 billion.9 According to observers in that sector, “Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check.”10 In addition, there are so-called robo-advisers that “create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers.”11 These advances are designed to take the emotion out of investing and undertake decisions based on analytical considerations, and make these choices in a matter of minutes.\nA prominent example of this is taking place in stock exchanges, where high-frequency trading by machines has replaced much of human decisionmaking. People submit buy and sell orders, and computers match them in the blink of an eye without human intervention. Machines can spot trading inefficiencies or market differentials on a very small scale and execute trades that make money according to investor instructions.12 Powered in some places by advanced computing, these tools have much greater capacities for storing information because of their emphasis not on a zero or a one, but on “quantum bits” that can store multiple values in each location.13 That dramatically increases storage capacity and decreases processing times.\nFraud detection represents another way AI is helpful in financial systems. It sometimes is difficult to discern fraudulent activities in large organizations, but AI can identify abnormalities, outliers, or deviant cases requiring additional investigation. That helps managers find problems early in the cycle, before they reach dangerous levels.14\nNational security\nAI plays a substantial role in national defense. Through its Project Maven, the American military is deploying AI “to sift through the massive troves of data and video captured by surveillance and then alert human analysts of patterns or when there is abnormal or suspicious activity.”15 According to Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, the goal of emerging technologies in this area is “to meet our warfighters’ needs and to increase [the] speed and agility [of] technology development and procurement.”16\nArtificial intelligence will accelerate the traditional process of warfare so rapidly that a new term has been coined: hyperwar.\nThe big data analytics associated with AI will profoundly affect intelligence analysis, as massive amounts of data are sifted in near real time—if not eventually in real time—thereby providing commanders and their staffs a level of intelligence analysis and productivity heretofore unseen. Command and control will similarly be affected as human commanders delegate certain routine, and in special circumstances, key decisions to AI platforms, reducing dramatically the time associated with the decision and subsequent action. In the end, warfare is a time competitive process, where the side able to decide the fastest and move most quickly to execution will generally prevail. Indeed, artificially intelligent intelligence systems, tied to AI-assisted command and control systems, can move decision support and decisionmaking to a speed vastly superior to the speeds of the traditional means of waging war. So fast will be this process, especially if coupled to automatic decisions to launch artificially intelligent autonomous weapons systems capable of lethal outcomes, that a new term has been coined specifically to embrace the speed at which war will be waged: hyperwar.\nWhile the ethical and legal debate is raging over whether America will ever wage war with artificially intelligent autonomous lethal systems, the Chinese and Russians are not nearly so mired in this debate, and we should anticipate our need to defend against these systems operating at hyperwar speeds. The challenge in the West of where to position “humans in the loop” in a hyperwar scenario will ultimately dictate the West’s capacity to be competitive in this new form of conflict.17\nJust as AI will profoundly affect the speed of warfare, the proliferation of zero day or zero second cyber threats as well as polymorphic malware will challenge even the most sophisticated signature-based cyber protection. This forces significant improvement to existing cyber defenses. Increasingly, vulnerable systems are migrating, and will need to shift to a layered approach to cybersecurity with cloud-based, cognitive AI platforms. This approach moves the community toward a “thinking” defensive capability that can defend networks through constant training on known threats. This capability includes DNA-level analysis of heretofore unknown code, with the possibility of recognizing and stopping inbound malicious code by recognizing a string component of the file. This is how certain key U.S.-based systems stopped the debilitating “WannaCry” and “Petya” viruses.\nPreparing for hyperwar and defending critical cyber networks must become a high priority because China, Russia, North Korea, and other countries are putting substantial resources into AI. In 2017, China’s State Council issued a plan for the country to “build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion” by 2030.18 As an example of the possibilities, the Chinese search firm Baidu has pioneered a facial recognition application that finds missing people. In addition, cities such as Shenzhen are providing up to $1 million to support AI labs. That country hopes AI will provide security, combat terrorism, and improve speech recognition programs.19 The dual-use nature of many AI algorithms will mean AI research focused on one sector of society can be rapidly modified for use in the security sector as well.20\nHealth care\nAI tools are helping designers improve computational sophistication in health care. For example, Merantix is a German company that applies deep learning to medical issues. It has an application in medical imaging that “detects lymph nodes in the human body in Computer Tomography (CT) images.”21 According to its developers, the key is labeling the nodes and identifying small lesions or growths that could be problematic. Humans can do this, but radiologists charge $100 per hour and may be able to carefully read only four images an hour. If there were 10,000 images, the cost of this process would be $250,000, which is prohibitively expensive if done by humans.\nWhat deep learning can do in this situation is train computers on data sets to learn what a normal-looking versus an irregular-appearing lymph node is. After doing that through imaging exercises and honing the accuracy of the labeling, radiological imaging specialists can apply this knowledge to actual patients and determine the extent to which someone is at risk of cancerous lymph nodes. Since only a few are likely to test positive, it is a matter of identifying the unhealthy versus healthy node.\nAI has been applied to congestive heart failure as well, an illness that afflicts 10 percent of senior citizens and costs $35 billion each year in the United States. AI tools are helpful because they “predict in advance potential challenges ahead and allocate resources to patient education, sensing, and proactive interventions that keep patients out of the hospital.”22\nCriminal justice\nAI is being deployed in the criminal justice area. The city of Chicago has developed an AI-driven “Strategic Subject List” that analyzes people who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators. It ranks 400,000 people on a scale of 0 to 500, using items such as age, criminal activity, victimization, drug arrest records, and gang affiliation. In looking at the data, analysts found that youth is a strong predictor of violence, being a shooting victim is associated with becoming a future perpetrator, gang affiliation has little predictive value, and drug arrests are not significantly associated with future criminal activity.23\nJudicial experts claim AI programs reduce human bias in law enforcement and leads to a fairer sentencing system. R Street Institute Associate Caleb Watney writes:\nEmpirically grounded questions of predictive risk analysis play to the strengths of machine learning, automated reasoning and other forms of AI. One machine-learning policy simulation concluded that such programs could be used to cut crime up to 24.8 percent with no change in jailing rates, or reduce jail populations by up to 42 percent with no increase in crime rates.24\nHowever, critics worry that AI algorithms represent “a secret system to punish citizens for crimes they haven’t yet committed. The risk scores have been used numerous times to guide large-scale roundups.”25 The fear is that such tools target people of color unfairly and have not helped Chicago reduce the murder wave that has plagued it in recent years.\nDespite these concerns, other countries are moving ahead with rapid deployment in this area. In China, for example, companies already have “considerable resources and access to voices, faces and other biometric data in vast quantities, which would help them develop their technologies.”26 New technologies make it possible to match images and voices with other types of information, and to use AI on these combined data sets to improve law enforcement and national security. Through its “Sharp Eyes” program, Chinese law enforcement is matching video images, social media activity, online purchases, travel records, and personal identity into a “police cloud.” This integrated database enables authorities to keep track of criminals, potential law-breakers, and terrorists.27 Put differently, China has become the world’s leading AI-powered surveillance state.\nTransportation\nTransportation represents an area where AI and machine learning are producing major innovations. Research by Cameron Kerry and Jack Karsten of the Brookings Institution has found that over $80 billion was invested in autonomous vehicle technology between August 2014 and June 2017. Those investments include applications both for autonomous driving and the core technologies vital to that sector.28\nAutonomous vehicles—cars, trucks, buses, and drone delivery systems—use advanced technological capabilities. Those features include automated vehicle guidance and braking, lane-changing systems, the use of cameras and sensors for collision avoidance, the use of AI to analyze information in real time, and the use of high-performance computing and deep learning systems to adapt to new circumstances through detailed maps.29\nLight detection and ranging systems (LIDARs) and AI are key to navigation and collision avoidance. LIDAR systems combine light and radar instruments. They are mounted on the top of vehicles that use imaging in a 360-degree environment from a radar and light beams to measure the speed and distance of surrounding objects. Along with sensors placed on the front, sides, and back of the vehicle, these instruments provide information that keeps fast-moving cars and trucks in their own lane, helps them avoid other vehicles, applies brakes and steering when needed, and does so instantly so as to avoid accidents.\nAdvanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change. This means that software is the key—not the physical car or truck itself.\nSince these cameras and sensors compile a huge amount of information and need to process it instantly to avoid the car in the next lane, autonomous vehicles require high-performance computing, advanced algorithms, and deep learning systems to adapt to new scenarios. This means that software is the key, not the physical car or truck itself.30 Advanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change.31\nRide-sharing companies are very interested in autonomous vehicles. They see advantages in terms of customer service and labor productivity. All of the major ride-sharing companies are exploring driverless cars. The surge of car-sharing and taxi services—such as Uber and Lyft in the United States, Daimler’s Mytaxi and Hailo service in Great Britain, and Didi Chuxing in China—demonstrate the opportunities of this transportation option. Uber recently signed an agreement to purchase 24,000 autonomous cars from Volvo for its ride-sharing service.32\nHowever, the ride-sharing firm suffered a setback in March 2018 when one of its autonomous vehicles in Arizona hit and killed a pedestrian. Uber and several auto manufacturers immediately suspended testing and launched investigations into what went wrong and how the fatality could have occurred.33 Both industry and consumers want reassurance that the technology is safe and able to deliver on its stated promises. Unless there are persuasive answers, this accident could slow AI advancements in the transportation sector.\nSmart cities\nMetropolitan governments are using AI to improve urban service delivery. For example, according to Kevin Desouza, Rashmi Krishnamurthy, and Gregory Dawson:\nThe Cincinnati Fire Department is using data analytics to optimize medical emergency responses. The new analytics system recommends to the dispatcher an appropriate response to a medical emergency call—whether a patient can be treated on-site or needs to be taken to the hospital—by taking into account several factors, such as the type of call, location, weather, and similar calls.34\nSince it fields 80,000 requests each year, Cincinnati officials are deploying this technology to prioritize responses and determine the best ways to handle emergencies. They see AI as a way to deal with large volumes of data and figure out efficient ways of responding to public requests. Rather than address service issues in an ad hoc manner, authorities are trying to be proactive in how they provide urban services.\nCincinnati is not alone. A number of metropolitan areas are adopting smart city applications that use AI to improve service delivery, environmental planning, resource management, energy utilization, and crime prevention, among other things. For its smart cities index, the magazine Fast Company ranked American locales and found Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City as the top adopters. Seattle, for example, has embraced sustainability and is using AI to manage energy usage and resource management. Boston has launched a “City Hall To Go” that makes sure underserved communities receive needed public services. It also has deployed “cameras and inductive loops to manage traffic and acoustic sensors to identify gun shots.” San Francisco has certified 203 buildings as meeting LEED sustainability standards.35\nThrough these and other means, metropolitan areas are leading the country in the deployment of AI solutions. Indeed, according to a National League of Cities report, 66 percent of American cities are investing in smart city technology. Among the top applications noted in the report are “smart meters for utilities, intelligent traffic signals, e-governance applications, Wi-Fi kiosks, and radio frequency identification sensors in pavement.”36\nPolicy, regulatory, and ethical issues\nThese examples from a variety of sectors demonstrate how AI is transforming many walks of human existence. The increasing penetration of AI and autonomous devices into many aspects of life is altering basic operations and decisionmaking within organizations, and improving efficiency and response times.\nAt the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues. For example, how should we promote data access? How do we guard against biased or unfair data used in algorithms? What types of ethical principles are introduced through software programming, and how transparent should designers be about their choices? What about questions of legal liability in cases where algorithms cause harm?37\nThe increasing penetration of AI into many aspects of life is altering decisionmaking within organizations and improving efficiency. At the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues.\nData access problems\nThe key to getting the most out of AI is having a “data-friendly ecosystem with unified standards and cross-platform sharing.” AI depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought to bear on concrete problems. Having data that are “accessible for exploration” in the research community is a prerequisite for successful AI development.38\nAccording to a McKinsey Global Institute study, nations that promote open data sources and data sharing are the ones most likely to see AI advances. In this regard, the United States has a substantial advantage over China. Global ratings on data openness show that U.S. ranks eighth overall in the world, compared to 93 for China.39\nBut right now, the United States does not have a coherent national data strategy. There are few protocols for promoting research access or platforms that make it possible to gain new insights from proprietary data. It is not always clear who owns data or how much belongs in the public sphere. These uncertainties limit the innovation economy and act as a drag on academic research. In the following section, we outline ways to improve data access for researchers.\nBiases in data and algorithms\nIn some instances, certain AI systems are thought to have enabled discriminatory or biased practices.40 For example, Airbnb has been accused of having homeowners on its platform who discriminate against racial minorities. A research project undertaken by the Harvard Business School found that “Airbnb users with distinctly African American names were roughly 16 percent less likely to be accepted as guests than those with distinctly white names.”41\nRacial issues also come up with facial recognition software. Most such systems operate by comparing a person’s face to a range of faces in a large database. As pointed out by Joy Buolamwini of the Algorithmic Justice League, “If your facial recognition data contains mostly Caucasian faces, that’s what your program will learn to recognize.”42 Unless the databases have access to diverse data, these programs perform poorly when attempting to recognize African-American or Asian-American features.\nMany historical data sets reflect traditional values, which may or may not represent the preferences wanted in a current system. As Buolamwini notes, such an approach risks repeating inequities of the past:\nThe rise of automation and the increased reliance on algorithms for high-stakes decisions such as whether someone get insurance or not, your likelihood to default on a loan or somebody’s risk of recidivism means this is something that needs to be addressed. Even admissions decisions are increasingly automated—what school our children go to and what opportunities they have. We don’t have to bring the structural inequalities of the past into the future we create.43\nAI ethics and transparency\nAlgorithms embed ethical considerations and value choices into program decisions. As such, these systems raise questions concerning the criteria used in automated decisionmaking. Some people want to have a better understanding of how algorithms function and what choices are being made.44\nIn the United States, many urban schools use algorithms for enrollment decisions based on a variety of considerations, such as parent preferences, neighborhood qualities, income level, and demographic background. According to Brookings researcher Jon Valant, the New Orleans–based Bricolage Academy “gives priority to economically disadvantaged applicants for up to 33 percent of available seats. In practice, though, most cities have opted for categories that prioritize siblings of current students, children of school employees, and families that live in school’s broad geographic area.”45 Enrollment choices can be expected to be very different when considerations of this sort come into play.\nDepending on how AI systems are set up, they can facilitate the redlining of mortgage applications, help people discriminate against individuals they don’t like, or help screen or build rosters of individuals based on unfair criteria. The types of considerations that go into programming decisions matter a lot in terms of how the systems operate and how they affect customers.46\nFor these reasons, the EU is implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. The rules specify that people have “the right to opt out of personally tailored ads” and “can contest ‘legal or similarly significant’ decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention” in the form of an explanation of how the algorithm generated a particular outcome. Each guideline is designed to ensure the protection of personal data and provide individuals with information on how the “black box” operates.47\nLegal liability\nThere are questions concerning the legal liability of AI systems. If there are harms or infractions (or fatalities in the case of driverless cars), the operators of the algorithm likely will fall under product liability rules. A body of case law has shown that the situation’s facts and circumstances determine liability and influence the kind of penalties that are imposed. Those can range from civil fines to imprisonment for major harms.48 The Uber-related fatality in Arizona will be an important test case for legal liability. The state actively recruited Uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company considerable latitude in terms of road testing. It remains to be seen if there will be lawsuits in this case and who is sued: the human backup driver, the state of Arizona, the Phoenix suburb where the accident took place, Uber, software developers, or the auto manufacturer. Given the multiple people and organizations involved in the road testing, there are many legal questions to be resolved.\nIn non-transportation areas, digital platforms often have limited liability for what happens on their sites. For example, in the case of Airbnb, the firm “requires that people agree to waive their right to sue, or to join in any class-action lawsuit or class-action arbitration, to use the service.” By demanding that its users sacrifice basic rights, the company limits consumer protections and therefore curtails the ability of people to fight discrimination arising from unfair algorithms.49 But whether the principle of neutral networks holds up in many sectors is yet to be determined on a widespread basis.\nRecommendations\nIn order to balance innovation with basic human values, we propose a number of recommendations for moving forward with AI. This includes improving data access, increasing government investment in AI, promoting AI workforce development, creating a federal advisory committee, engaging with state and local officials to ensure they enact effective policies, regulating broad objectives as opposed to specific algorithms, taking bias seriously as an AI issue, maintaining mechanisms for human control and oversight, and penalizing malicious behavior and promoting cybersecurity.\nImproving data access\nThe United States should develop a data strategy that promotes innovation and consumer protection. Right now, there are no uniform standards in terms of data access, data sharing, or data protection. Almost all the data are proprietary in nature and not shared very broadly with the research community, and this limits innovation and system design. AI requires data to test and improve its learning capacity.50 Without structured and unstructured data sets, it will be nearly impossible to gain the full benefits of artificial intelligence.\nIn general, the research community needs better access to government and business data, although with appropriate safeguards to make sure researchers do not misuse data in the way Cambridge Analytica did with Facebook information. There is a variety of ways researchers could gain data access.

To read more recent content from Brookings on Artificial Intelligence, please visit the AI topic page.\nMost people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI). As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.1 A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.\nDespite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIn this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2\nIn order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward:\n- Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users’ personal privacy,\n- invest more government funding in unclassified AI research,\n- promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy,\n- create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations,\n- engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies,\n- regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms,\n- take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms,\n- maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and\n- penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.\n Qualities of artificial intelligence\nAlthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.\n']","Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in modern society and has a transformative impact on business processes. It is a technology that enables computers to process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Some of the key significances of AI in society and its impact on businesses include:

1. **Enhanced Decision Making**: AI helps organizations analyze data and generate insights that improve decision-making processes. This leads to more accurate forecasts and strategic planning.

2. **Automation of Routine Tasks**: Businesses use AI to automate repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on more complex and creative work. This enhances productivity and efficiency.

3. **Personalization**: In sectors like retail and marketing, AI helps personalize customer experiences by analyzing customer data and preferences, leading to targeted advertisements and recommendations.

4. **Improved Customer Service**: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide customers with real-time support, improving customer satisfaction and reducing response times.

5. **Operational Efficiency**: AI optimizes supply chains, inventory management, and logistics by predicting demand and streamlining operations, ultimately reducing costs.

6. **Innovation in Products and Services**: AI enables the development of new products and services, such as autonomous vehicles, smart assistants, and personalized health care solutions, offering competitive advantages to organizations.

7. **Risk Management**: AI aids in identifying potential risks and mitigating them, particularly in finance through fraud detection and predictive analytics.

Overall, AI is reshaping how businesses operate, enabling them to become more agile, efficient, and customer-focused, while also driving innovation across various sectors.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that is transforming every walk of life.

"What does Figure 22 illustrate about the variation in ChatGPT usage by education, particularly in relation to work-related messages?","['•Sampled from all ChatGPT users:a random sample of approximately one million de-\nidentified messages from logged-in consumer ChatGPT users between May 2024 and June\n2025.14 This dataset is primarily used in Section 5.\n•Sampled from a subset of ChatGPT users:two random samples of messages sent\nbetween May 2024 and July 2025 by a subset of consumer ChatGPT users (one sample at\nthe conversation level, one sample at the user level). 15 These datasets are primarily used\nin Section 6.\n3.Employment:aggregated employment and education categories based on publicly available\ndata for a subset of consumer ChatGPT users. This data is only used in Section 6.\nWe describe the contents of each dataset, the sampling procedures that produced them, and the\nprivacy protections we implemented in constructing and employing them in analysis.\n3.1 Growth Dataset\nWe compiled a dataset covering all usage on consumer ChatGPT Plans (Free, Plus, Pro) since Chat-\nGPT’s launch in November 2022. We exclude users on non-consumer plans (Business f.k.a. Teams,\n14The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and June 26, 2025.\n15The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and July 31, 2025.\n5\x0cEnterprise, Education).\nFor each user and day, this dataset reports the total number of messages sent by the user on that\nday. It also reports, for each message, de-identified user metadata, including the timestamp of their\nfirst interaction with ChatGPT, the country from which their account is registered, their subscription\nplan on each day, and their self-reported age (reported in coarse 5–7-year buckets to protect user\nprivacy).\n3.2 Classified Messages\nTo understand usage while preserving user privacy, we construct message-level datasets without any\nhuman ever reading the contents of a message. See Figure 1 for an overview of the privacy-preserving\nclassification pipeline. Messages are categorized according to 5 different LLM-based classifiers. The\nclassifiers are introduced in more detail in Section 5, their exact text is reproduced in Appendix A,\nand our validation procedure is described in Appendix B.\nSampled From All ChatGPT Users.We uniformly sampled approximately 1.1 million conver-\nsations, and then sampled one message within each conversation, with the following restrictions:\n1. We only include messages from May 2024 to July 2025.\n2. We exclude conversations from users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training.\n3. We exclude users who self-report their age as under 18.\n4. We exclude conversations that users have deleted and from users whose accounts have been\ndeactivated or banned.\n5. We exclude logged-out users, 16 which represented a minority share of ChatGPT users over the\nsample period.\nOur sample is drawn from a table that is itself sampled, where the sampling rate varied over time.\nWe thus adjust our sampling weights to maintain a fixed ratio with aggregate messages sent.\nSampled From a Subset of ChatGPT Users.We construct two samples of classified messages\nfrom a subset of ChatGPT users (approximately 130,000 users). This sample of users does not include\nany users who opted out of sharing their messages for training, nor does it include users whose self-\nreported age is below 18, nor does it include users who have been banned or deleted their accounts.\nThe first sample contains classifications of 1.58 million messages from this subset of users, sampled\nat the conversation level (a conversation is a series of messages between the user and chatbot). This\nsample is constructed such that the user’s representation in the data is proportional to overall message\nvolume. The second sample contains messages sent from this subset of users, sampled at the user level\nwith up to six messages from each user in the group.\n16ChatGPT became available to logged-out users in April 2024, i.e., users could use ChatGPT without signing up\nfor an account with an email address. However, messages from logged-out users are only available in our dataset from\nMarch 2025, thus for consistency we drop all messages from logged-out users.\n6\x0cFigure 1:Illustration of Privacy-Preserving Automated Classification Pipeline (Synthetic Example). Mes-\nsages are first stripped of PII via an internal LLM-based tool calledPrivacy Filter. Then they are classified by\nLLM-based automated classifiers, described in detail in Appendices A and B. Humans do not see raw messages\nor PII-scrubbed messages, only the final classifications of messages.\nPrivacy via Automated Classifiers.No one looked at the content of messages while conducting\nanalysis for this paper. All analysis of message content was performed via automated LLM-based\nclassifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed message data (see Figure 1). The messages are first\nscrubbed of PII using an internal LLM-based tool,17 and then classified according to classifiers defined\nover a controlled label space—the most precise classifier we use on the message-level data set is the\nO*NET Intermediate Work Activities taxonomy, which we augment to end up with 333 categories.\nWe introduce technical and procedural frictions that prevent accidental access to the underlying text\n(for example, interfaces that do not render message text to researchers).\nOur classifications aim to discern the intent of a given message, and thus we include the prior 10\nmessages in a conversation as context. 18 For an example, see Table 2.\nStand-Alone Message Message with Prior Context\n[user]: “10 more” [user]: “give me 3 cultural activities to do with teens”\n[assistant]: “1. Visit a museum . . . ” (truncated)\n[user]: “10 more”\nTable 2:Illustration of Context-Augmented Message Classifications (Synthetic Example). The left column\nshows a standalone message to be classified, and the right column shows the prior context included in the\nclassification of the message on the left.\nWe truncate each message to a maximum of 5,000 characters, because long context windows could\ninduce variability in the quality of the classification (Liu et al., 2023). We classify each message\nwith the “gpt-5-mini” model, with the exception ofInteraction Quality,which uses “gpt-5,” using the\nprompts listed in Appendix A.\n17Internal analyses show that the tool,Privacy Filter, has substantial alignment with human judgment.\n18In the case ofInteraction Quality,we additionally include the next two messages in the conversation as context.\n7\x0cWe validated each of the classification prompts by comparing model classification decisions against\nhuman-judged classifications of a sample of conversations from the publicly available WildChat dataset\n(Zhao et al., 2024), a set of conversations with a third-party chatbot which users affirmatively gave\ntheir assent to share publicly for research purposes. 19 Appendix B provides detail on our validation\napproach and performance relative to human judgment. For additional transparency, we classify\na sample of 100,000 public WildChat messages and provide those data in this paper’s replication\npackage.\n3.3 Employment Dataset\nWe conduct limited analyses of aggregated employment categories based on publicly available data\nfor a sample of consumer ChatGPT users. This sample included approximately 130,000 Free, Plus,\nand Pro users, and the employment categories were aggregated by a vendor working through a secure\nData Clean Room (DCR). For this analysis, we use the same exclusion criteria as for the message-level\ndatasets: we exclude deactivated users, banned users, users who have opted out of training, and users\nwhose self-reported age is under 18. Because the data was only available for a subset of users the\nresults may not be representative of the full pool of users.\nDescription.The employment data, which is aggregated from publicly available sources, includes\nindustry, occupations coarsened to O*NET categories, seniority level, company size, and education\ninformation that is limited to the degree attained. A vendor working within a DCR procured this\ndataset, restricted us to running only aggregated queries against it through the DCR, and deleted it\nupon the study’s completion.\nPrivacy via a Data Clean Room.We never directly accessed user-level demographic records.\nAll analysis of employment data was executed exclusively within a secure DCR that permits only\npre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or\nexport the other party’s underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute\nany query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a\ncommittee of 6 coauthors and then submitted the notebook to our data partner for approval; only\napproved notebooks could run in the DCR (see Figure 2).\nOur partner enforced strict aggregation limits: they only approved code that returned cells meeting\na threshold of 100 users. Consequently, no individual rows or narrowly defined categories were ever\nvisible to researchers. For example, if 99 users had the occupation “anesthesiologist,” any occupation-\nlevel output would place those users into a “suppressed” category, or place these observations in a\ncoarsened category (e.g. “medical professionals”) rather than reporting a separate cell of anesthesiol-\nogists.\n19The dataset was collected from a third party chatbot using OpenAI’s LLMs via their API.\n8\x0cFigure 2:Illustration of Aggregated Employment Category Analysis via a Data Clean Room. All queries run\nin the Data Clean Room must be approved by our data partner, enforcing a strict aggregation threshold (100\nobservations). As a result, researchers cannot access user-level employment data, only aggregated employment\ncategories.\n3.4 Summarizing Our Approach to Privacy\nWe took measures to safeguard user privacy at every stage of analysis. To summarize, the key elements\nof our approach are:\nAutomated classification of messages.In the course of analysis, no one ever looked directly\nat the content of user messages: all of our analysis of the content of user messages is done\nthrough output of automated classifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed usage data.\nAggregated employment data via a data clean room.We analyze and report aggregated\nemployment data through a secure data clean room environment: no one on the research\nteam had direct access to user-level demographic data and none of our analyses report\naggregates for groups with less than 100 users.\nIn following these measures, we aim to match or exceed the privacy protection precedents set by\nother social scientists studying chatbots and those linking digital platform data to external sources.\nWe follow the precedent established in recent analyses of chatbot conversations (Phang et al.\n(2025), Eloundou et al. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)) that rely on automated\nclassification rather than human inspection of raw transcripts. In particular, Phang et al. (2025)’s\nstudy of affective use of ChatGPT and Eloundou et al. (2025) investigation of first-person fairness in\nchatbots both analyze ChatGPT message content via automated classifiers and emphasize classifier-\nbased labeling as a scalable, privacy-preserving approach. Anthropic’s Handa et al. (2025) used a\nsimilar approach: theirCliomethodology applies automated classifiers to large collections of conver-\nsations, classifying conversations into thousands of topics, and in their appendix they describe manual\nvalidation on sampled conversations (100 user conversations flagged for review and 100 randomly sam-\npled calibrations). Like Eloundou et al., we validate our classifiers using WildChat, a public dataset\nof user conversations.\n9\x0cOther papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant\nprecedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for exam-\nple, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data.\nChetty et al. (2022) analyze de-identified Facebook friendship graphs and anonymized IRS tax records,\naggregated at the zip code level.\n4 The Growth of ChatGPT\nChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December\n5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active\nusers (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after\none year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than\n700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population. 20\nFigure 3:Weekly active ChatGPT users on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), shown as point-in-time\nsnapshots every six months, November 2022–September 2025.\nFigure 4 presents growth in the total messages sent by users over time. The solid line shows that\nbetween July 2024 and July 2025, the number of messages sent grew by a factor of more than 5.\nFigure 4 also shows the contribution of individual cohorts of users to aggregate message volume.\nThe yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over\n2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been. The pink line\nrepresents messages from users who signed up in Q3 of 2023 or earlier, and so thedifferencebetween\n20Note that we expect our counts of distinct accounts to somewhat exceed distinct people when one person has two\naccounts (or, for logged-out users, one person using two devices). For logged-in users, the count is based on distinct\nlogin credentials (email addresses), and one person may have multiple accounts. For logged-out users, the count is based\non distinct browser cookies; this would double-count people if someone returns to ChatGPT after clearing their cookies,\nor if they access ChatGPT with two different devices in the same week.\n10\x0cFigure 4:Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of\nthe requesting user. Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days. Y-axis is an index normalized\nto the reported value for ”All Cohorts” at the end of Q1 2024 (April 1, 2024).\nthe yellow and pink lines represents the messages sent by users who signed up in Q2 and Q3 of 2023.\nThere has been dramatic growth in message volume both by new cohorts of users, and from growth\nin existing cohorts.\nFigure 5 normalizes each cohort, plotting daily messages per weekly active user. Each line rep-\nresents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that\nearlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within\nevery cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,\nand (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.\n5 How ChatGPT is Used\nWe next report on thecontentof ChatGPT conversations using a variety of different taxonomies. For\neach taxonomy we describe a “prompt” which defines a set of categories, and then apply an LLM\nto map each message to a category. Our categories often apply to the user’sintention, rather than\nthe text of the conversation, and as such we never directly observe the ground truth. Nevertheless\nthe classifier results can be interpreted as the best-guess inferences that a human would make: the\nguesses from the LLM correlate highly with human guesses from the same prompt, and we get similar\nqualitative results when the prompt includes a third category for “uncertain.”\n11\x0cFigure 5:Daily messages sent per weekly active user, split by sign-up cohort. Sample only considers users of\nChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro). Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days and are\nreported starting 90 days after the cohort is fully formed. Y-axis is an index normalized to the first reported\nvalue for the Q1 2023 cohort.\n5.1 What share of ChatGPT queries are related to paid work?\nWe label each user message in our dataset based on whether it appears to be related to work, using\nan LLM classifier. The critical part of the prompt is as follows: 21\nDoes the last user message of this conversation transcript seem likely to be related to doing\nsome work/employment? Answer with one of the following:\n(1) likely part of work (e.g., “rewrite this HR complaint”)\n(0) likely not part of work (e.g., “does ice reduce pimples?”)\nTable 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however\nnon-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which\nclimbed to 73% by June 2025.\nFigure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-\nsive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work\nuse has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest\ncohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.\n21See Appendix A for the full prompt, see Appendix B for validation.\n12\x0cFigure 6:The solid black line represents the probability that a messages on a given day is not related to\nwork, as determined by an automated classifier. Values are averaged over a 28-day lagging window. The\ndotted orange line shows the same calculation, but conditioned on messages being from users who first used\nChatGPT during or before Q2 of 2024. The remaining lines are defined similarly for successive quarters, with\ncoloring cooling for more recent cohorts. Counts are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million\nsampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total\nmessage volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n5.2 What are the topics of ChatGPT conversations?\nWe modify a classifier used by internal research teams at OpenAI that identifies which capabilities\nthe user is requesting from ChatGPT. The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation\nTopics arePractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting, collectively accounting for about\n77% of all ChatGPT conversations.Practical Guidancehas remained constant at roughly 29% of\noverall usage.Writinghas declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later.Seeking\nInformationhas grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between GWA and two-digit SOC2 codes.\n35\x0c7 Conclusion\nThis paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,\nChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more\nthan 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-\ntion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new\ntechnology is used and who is using it.\nThis is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while\nintroducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans\nduring any part of the work on this paper.\nThis paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%\nof ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related\nqueries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.\nSecond, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing,\nandSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro-\ngrammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages\nrespectively.\nThird,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages\noverall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About\ntwo-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text\nfrom scratch.\nFourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we\ncallAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,\nadvice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process\n(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing).Askingmessages have grown\nfaster thanDoingmessages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that\nmeasures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.\nFifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,\nmore than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages\nsent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially\nfast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly\neducated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related\nmessages and forAskingrather thanDoingmessages at work.\nOverall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.\nThe fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI\nusage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to\nbe paid$98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least$97 billion a\nyear. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT\nas an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still,\nChatGPT likely improves worker output by providingdecision support, which is especially important\nin knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making.\n36\x0cReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron, “The Simple Macroeconomics of AI,” Technical Report 32487, National Bureau\nof Economic Research, Cambridge, MA May 2024.\nAutor, David H., Frank Levy, and Richard J.

The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation\nTopics arePractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting, collectively accounting for about\n77% of all ChatGPT conversations.Practical Guidancehas remained constant at roughly 29% of\noverall usage.Writinghas declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later.Seeking\nInformationhas grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

Sampling details\navailable in Section 3.\n15\x0csuggests that most userWritingconversations with ChatGPT are requests to modify user inputs\nrather than to create something new. Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\nmessages and 36% ofPractical Guidancemessages are requests forTutoring or Teaching. Another\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% ofPractical Guidance- is general how-to advice on a variety\nof topics.Technical HelpincludesComputer Programming(4.2% of messages),Mathematical Calcu-\nlations(3%), andData Analysis(0.4%). Looking at the topic ofSelf-Expression, only 2.4% of all\nChatGPT messages are aboutRelationships and Personal Reflection(1.9%) orGames and Role Play\n(0.4%).\nWhile users can seek information and advice from traditional web search engines as well as from\nChatGPT, the ability to produce writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products\ndistinguishes generative AI from existing technologies. ChatGPT is also more flexible than web\nsearch even for traditional applications likeSeeking InformationandPractical Guidance, because\nusers receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy\nfootball team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided\ncontent and follow-up requests.\nFigure 9:Breakdown of granular conversation topic shares within the coarse mapping defined in Table 3. The\nunderlying classifier prompt is available in Appendix A. Each bin reports a percentage of the total population.\nShares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024\nthrough June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day. Sampling\ndetails available in Section 3.\n5.3 User Intent\nExisting studies of the economic impacts of generative AI focus almost exclusively on the potential\nfor AI to perform workplace tasks, either augmenting or automating human labor (e.g. Eloundou et\nal. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)). However, generative AI is a highly flexible\n16\x0ctechnology that can be used in many different ways. In order to learn more about how people seek to\nuse generative AI at work and outside of work, we introduce a classifier that is designed to measure the\ntype of output the user hopes to receive. Specifically, we classify messages according to user intent,\ncoding up conversations according to a simpleAsking, Doing, or Expressingrubric. The critical part\nof our classification prompt is as follows:\nIntent Prompt\nAskingAsking is seeking information or advice that will help the user be better\ninformed or make better decisions, either at work, at school, or in their\npersonal life. (e.g. “Who was president after Lincoln?”, “How do I create a\nbudget for this quarter?”, “What was the inflation rate last year?”,\n“What’s the difference between correlation and causation?”, “What should I\nlook for when choosing a health plan during open enrollment?”).\nDoingDoing messages request that ChatGPT perform tasks for the user. User is\ndrafting an email, writing code, etc. Classify messages as “doing” if they\ninclude requests for output that is created primarily by the model. (e.g.\n“Rewrite this email to make it more formal”, “Draft a report summarizing\nthe use cases of ChatGPT”, “Produce a project timeline with milestones\nand risks in a table”, “Extract companies, people, and dates from this text\ninto CSV.”, “Write a Dockerfile and a minimal docker-compose.yml for\nthis app.”)\nExpressingExpressing statements are neither asking for information, nor for the\nchatbot to perform a task.\nConceptually,Doingconversations are delivering output that can be plugged into a production\nprocess, whileAskingconversations support decision-making but do not produce output directly, and\nExpressingconversations have little or no economic content.\nFigure 10 shows the share of messages by each intent type in our sample. 49% of user messages\nareAsking, 40% areDoing, and 11% areExpressing. The figure also shows the relationship with\nour Topic classification: the two taxonomies are correlated but not redundant:Askingqueries are\nmore likely to bePractical GuidanceandSeeking Information.Doingqueries are disproportionately\nWritingandMultimedia.Expressingqueries are disproportionatelySelf-Expression. However, the\noverlap is imperfect. For example, within thePractical Guidancetopic, anAskingmessage might\nbe advice about how to recover from a sports injury given a user’s personal history, while aDoing\nmessage might request ChatGPT to produce a customized recovery and training plan that could be\nprinted or saved. WithinTechnical Help, anAskingmessage might request help understanding how\nto debug some code, while aDoingmessage might ask ChatGPT to write code for the user directly.\nFigure 11 presents shares ofAsking/Doing/Expressingjust for work-related messages.Doing\nconstitutes nearly 56% of work-related queries, compared to 35% forAskingand 9% forExpressing.\nNearly 35% of all work-related queries areDoingmessages related toWriting.DoingandAsking\ncomprise equal shares ofTechnical Helpqueries.\n17\x0cFigure 10:Breakdown of Conversation Topics by Asking/Doing/Expressing category, with topic columns\nsorted by relative share of ”Doing” messages.

In July\n2024, usage was evenly split betweenAskingandDoing, with just under 8% of messages classified as\nExpressing.AskingandExpressinggrew much faster thanDoingover the next year, and by late June\n2025 the split was 51.6%Asking, 34.6%Doing, and 13.8%Expressing.\nFigure 12:Shares of messages classified as Asking, Doing, or Expressing by an automated ternary classifier.\nValues are averaged over a 28 day lagging window. Shares are calculated from a sample of approximately\n1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to\nreflect total message volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\nFigure 13 presents the share of work-related messages by user intent.Doingmessages, which\naccount for approximately 40% of messages, have an even split of messages between work-related and\nnon-work related.\n5.4 O*NET Work Activities\nWe map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network (O*NET)\nDatabase Version 29.0, similar to Tomlinson et al (2025). O*NET was developed in partnership with\nthe U.S. Department of Labor and systematically classifies jobs according to the skills, tasks, and\nwork activities required to perform them. O*NET associates each occupation with a set of tasks that\nare performed at different levels of intensity. Each task is then aggregated up to three levels of detail\n- 2,087 detailed work activities (DWAs), 332 intermediate work activities (IWAs), and 41 generalized\nwork activities (GWAs).\nTo understand the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage, we mapped messages to one\nof the 332 O*NET Intermediate Work Activities (IWA), with an additional option ofAmbiguousto\naccount for situations where the user message lacked sufficient context. 22 We then used the official\n22We drew a sample of approximately 1.1 million conversations from May 2024 to June 2025, selected a random\nmessage within each, and classified it according to the prompt in A.\n19\x0cFigure 13:Shares of Asking, Doing, and Expressing messages split by work vs. non-work. See A to review\nthe prompts used by the automated classifiers. The annotations on the right show the shares of work and\nnon-work for the full sample. Each bin reports a percentage of the total population. Shares are calculated\nfrom a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025.\nObservations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in\nSection 3.\nO*NET taxonomy to map these classified IWAs to one of the Generalized Work Activities (GWA). We\ndo not show the shares for the following GWAs as there were fewer than 100 users sending messages\nfor each category and group them intoSuppressed.\nFigure 14 presents the share of messages that belong to each GWA, in descending order. Nearly\nhalf of all messages (45.2%) fall under just three GWAs related to information use and manipula-\ntion:Getting Information(19.3%),Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others(13.1%), and\nDocumenting/Recording Information(12.8%). The next most common work activities areProviding\nConsultation and Advice(9.2%),Thinking Creatively(9.1%),Making Decisions and Solving Problems\n(8.5%), andWorking with Computers(4.9%). These seven GWAs collectively account for 76.9% of\nall messages.\nFigure 15 presents the distribution of GWAs for the subsample of messages we classify as work-\nrelated. Among work-related messages, the most common GWAs areDocumenting/Recording In-\nformation(18.4%),Making Decisions and Solving Problems(14.9%),Thinking Creatively(13.0%),\nWorking with Computers(10.8%),Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others(10.1%),Get-\nting Information(9.3%), andProviding Consultation and Advice to Others(4.4%). These seven GWAs\ncollectively account for nearly 81% of work-related messages. Overall, the majority of ChatGPT usage\nat work appears to be focused on two broad functions: 1) obtaining, documenting, and interpreting\ninformation; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems, and thinking creatively.\n20\x0cFigure 14:GWA Shares of 1.1M ChatGPT Messages.

Prompts are provided in the Appendix.\n22\x0c5.5 Quality of Interactions\nWe additionally used automated classifiers to study the user’s apparent satisfaction with the chatbot’s\nresponse to their request. OurInteraction Qualityclassifier looks for an expression of satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction in the user’s subsequent message in the same conversation (if one exists), with three\npossible categories:Good,Bad, andUnknown. 23\nFigure 16 plots the overall growth of messages in these three buckets. In late 2024Goodinteractions\nwere about three times as common asBadinteractions, butGoodinteractions grew much more rapidly\nover the next nine months, and by July 2025 they were more than four times more common.\nFigure 16:Interaction quality shares, based on automated sentiment analysis of thenext responseprovided\nby the user. See Appendix B to understand how this classifier was validated. Values are averaged over a 28\nday lagging window. Shares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations\nfrom May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a\ngiven day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\nDetails on the validation of this classifier, along with measurements of how it correlates with\nexplicit thumbs up/thumbs down annotations from users, are included in Appendix B.\nFigure 17 shows the ratio of good-to-bad messages by conversation topic and interaction type, as\nrated by Interaction Quality. Panel A shows thatSelf-Expressionis the highest rated topic, with a\ngood-to-bad ratio of more than seven, consistent with the growth in this category.Multimediaand\nTechnical Helphave the lowest good-to-bad ratios (1.7 and 2.7 respectively). Panel B shows that\nAskingmessages are substantially more likely to receive a good rating thanDoingorExpressing\nmessages.\n23For this classifier we do not disclose the prompt.\n23\x0cFigure 17:AverageGoodtoBadratio for user interactions by Conversation Topic (Panel A) and Ask-\ning/Doing/Expressing classification (Panel B). The prompts for each of these automated classifiers (with the\nexception of interaction quality) are available in Appendix A. Values represent the average ratio from May 15,\n2024 through June 26, 2025, where observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given\nday. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n24\x0c6 Who Uses ChatGPT\nIn this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work\ndocuments variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in\nthe U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark\n(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently\nby men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.\nWe make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-\ngraphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for\nselected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have\nchanged over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by\neducation and occupation.\n6.1 Name Analysis\nWe investigate potential variation by gender by classifying a global random sample of over 1.1 million\nChatGPT users’ first names using public aggregated datasets of name-gender associations. We used\nthe World Gender Name Dictionary, and Social Security popular names, as well as datasets of popular\nBrazilian and Latin American names. This methodology is similar to that in (Hofstra et al., 2020)\nand (West et al., 2013). Names that were not in these datasets, or were flagged as ambiguous in the\ndatasets, or had significant disagreement amongst these datasets were classified asUnknown.\nExcludingUnknown, a significant share (around 80%) of the weekly active users (WAU) in the\nfirst few months after ChatGPT was released were by users with typically masculine first names.\nHowever, in the first half of 2025, we see the share of active users with typically feminine and typically\nmasculine names reach near-parity. By June 2025 we observe active users are more likely to have\ntypically feminine names. This suggests that gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have closed substantially\nover time.\nWe also study differences in usage topics. Users with typically female first names are relatively more\nlikely to send messages related toWritingandPractical Guidance. ']","['<1-hop>\n\n37% of messages are work-related\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, compared to 46% for users with exactly a bachelor’s\ndegree and 48% for those with some graduate education. Those differences are cut roughly in half\nafter adjusting for other characteristics, but they are still statistically significant at the less than 1\npercent level. Educated users are more likely to send work-related messages.\nPanel B explores variation by education in user intent.Askingconstitutes about 49% of messages\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, with little variation for more educated users. After\nregression adjustment, we find that users with a graduate degree are about two percentage points\nmore likely to use ChatGPT forAskingmessages, a difference that is statistically significant at the\n5% level. Prior to regression adjustment, the frequency ofDoingmessages is increasing in education.\nHowever, this pattern reverses after adjusting for other characteristics such as occupation. Users with\na graduate degree are about 1.6 percentage points less likely to sendDoingmessages than users with\nless than a bachelor’s degree, and the difference is statistically significant at the 10% level.\nPanel C studies variation by education in the frequency of four different conversation topics –\nPractical Guidance,Seeking Information,Technical Help, andWriting. We find only modest differ-\nences by education across most of these categories. The one exception is that the share of messages\nrelated toWritingis increasing in relation to education.\n28\x0cPanel A.Work Related\nPanel B1.Asking. Panel B2.Doing.\nPanel B3.Expressing.\nFigure 22:(continued on next page)\n29\x0cPanel C1.Writing. Panel C2.Technical Help.\nPanel C3.Seeking Information. Panel C4.Practical Guidance.\nFigure 22:Variation in ChatGPT usage by education. Each plot shows unadjusted vs. regression-adjusted\nestimates, with 95% confidence intervals. We regress each message share on education and occupation, control-\nling for the following covariates: age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, seniority within\nrole, company size, and industry. (To guarantee user privacy, we coarsen all covariates to broad categories and\nprogrammatically enforce that each group has at least 100 members prior to running the regression) We add\nthe coefficients on each education and occupation category to the unadjusted value for the reference category\nand compute 95% confidence intervals using the standard errors from the regression coefficients. The sample\nfor this regression is the approximately 40,000 users of the original 130,000 sample whose publicly available\noccupation was not blank or consisted of strictly special characters (as determined by a classification script).\nShares for each user are calculated by randomly sampling up to six conversations attributed to the user from\nMay 2024 through July 2025.\n30\x0c']",I don't have enough information to answer.,"Figure 22 illustrates the variation in ChatGPT usage by education, showing that 37% of messages are work-related for users with less than a bachelor’s degree, compared to 46% for those with a bachelor’s degree and 48% for users with some graduate education.

"What does Figure 22 show about how ChatGPT is used at work, especially in relation to work-related tasks?","['•Sampled from all ChatGPT users:a random sample of approximately one million de-\nidentified messages from logged-in consumer ChatGPT users between May 2024 and June\n2025.14 This dataset is primarily used in Section 5.\n•Sampled from a subset of ChatGPT users:two random samples of messages sent\nbetween May 2024 and July 2025 by a subset of consumer ChatGPT users (one sample at\nthe conversation level, one sample at the user level). 15 These datasets are primarily used\nin Section 6.\n3.Employment:aggregated employment and education categories based on publicly available\ndata for a subset of consumer ChatGPT users. This data is only used in Section 6.\nWe describe the contents of each dataset, the sampling procedures that produced them, and the\nprivacy protections we implemented in constructing and employing them in analysis.\n3.1 Growth Dataset\nWe compiled a dataset covering all usage on consumer ChatGPT Plans (Free, Plus, Pro) since Chat-\nGPT’s launch in November 2022. We exclude users on non-consumer plans (Business f.k.a. Teams,\n14The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and June 26, 2025.\n15The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and July 31, 2025.\n5\x0cEnterprise, Education).\nFor each user and day, this dataset reports the total number of messages sent by the user on that\nday. It also reports, for each message, de-identified user metadata, including the timestamp of their\nfirst interaction with ChatGPT, the country from which their account is registered, their subscription\nplan on each day, and their self-reported age (reported in coarse 5–7-year buckets to protect user\nprivacy).\n3.2 Classified Messages\nTo understand usage while preserving user privacy, we construct message-level datasets without any\nhuman ever reading the contents of a message. See Figure 1 for an overview of the privacy-preserving\nclassification pipeline. Messages are categorized according to 5 different LLM-based classifiers. The\nclassifiers are introduced in more detail in Section 5, their exact text is reproduced in Appendix A,\nand our validation procedure is described in Appendix B.\nSampled From All ChatGPT Users.We uniformly sampled approximately 1.1 million conver-\nsations, and then sampled one message within each conversation, with the following restrictions:\n1. We only include messages from May 2024 to July 2025.\n2. We exclude conversations from users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training.\n3. We exclude users who self-report their age as under 18.\n4. We exclude conversations that users have deleted and from users whose accounts have been\ndeactivated or banned.\n5. We exclude logged-out users, 16 which represented a minority share of ChatGPT users over the\nsample period.\nOur sample is drawn from a table that is itself sampled, where the sampling rate varied over time.\nWe thus adjust our sampling weights to maintain a fixed ratio with aggregate messages sent.\nSampled From a Subset of ChatGPT Users.We construct two samples of classified messages\nfrom a subset of ChatGPT users (approximately 130,000 users). This sample of users does not include\nany users who opted out of sharing their messages for training, nor does it include users whose self-\nreported age is below 18, nor does it include users who have been banned or deleted their accounts.\nThe first sample contains classifications of 1.58 million messages from this subset of users, sampled\nat the conversation level (a conversation is a series of messages between the user and chatbot). This\nsample is constructed such that the user’s representation in the data is proportional to overall message\nvolume. The second sample contains messages sent from this subset of users, sampled at the user level\nwith up to six messages from each user in the group.\n16ChatGPT became available to logged-out users in April 2024, i.e., users could use ChatGPT without signing up\nfor an account with an email address. However, messages from logged-out users are only available in our dataset from\nMarch 2025, thus for consistency we drop all messages from logged-out users.\n6\x0cFigure 1:Illustration of Privacy-Preserving Automated Classification Pipeline (Synthetic Example). Mes-\nsages are first stripped of PII via an internal LLM-based tool calledPrivacy Filter. Then they are classified by\nLLM-based automated classifiers, described in detail in Appendices A and B. Humans do not see raw messages\nor PII-scrubbed messages, only the final classifications of messages.\nPrivacy via Automated Classifiers.No one looked at the content of messages while conducting\nanalysis for this paper. All analysis of message content was performed via automated LLM-based\nclassifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed message data (see Figure 1). The messages are first\nscrubbed of PII using an internal LLM-based tool,17 and then classified according to classifiers defined\nover a controlled label space—the most precise classifier we use on the message-level data set is the\nO*NET Intermediate Work Activities taxonomy, which we augment to end up with 333 categories.\nWe introduce technical and procedural frictions that prevent accidental access to the underlying text\n(for example, interfaces that do not render message text to researchers).\nOur classifications aim to discern the intent of a given message, and thus we include the prior 10\nmessages in a conversation as context. 18 For an example, see Table 2.\nStand-Alone Message Message with Prior Context\n[user]: “10 more” [user]: “give me 3 cultural activities to do with teens”\n[assistant]: “1. Visit a museum . . . ” (truncated)\n[user]: “10 more”\nTable 2:Illustration of Context-Augmented Message Classifications (Synthetic Example). The left column\nshows a standalone message to be classified, and the right column shows the prior context included in the\nclassification of the message on the left.\nWe truncate each message to a maximum of 5,000 characters, because long context windows could\ninduce variability in the quality of the classification (Liu et al., 2023). We classify each message\nwith the “gpt-5-mini” model, with the exception ofInteraction Quality,which uses “gpt-5,” using the\nprompts listed in Appendix A.\n17Internal analyses show that the tool,Privacy Filter, has substantial alignment with human judgment.\n18In the case ofInteraction Quality,we additionally include the next two messages in the conversation as context.\n7\x0cWe validated each of the classification prompts by comparing model classification decisions against\nhuman-judged classifications of a sample of conversations from the publicly available WildChat dataset\n(Zhao et al., 2024), a set of conversations with a third-party chatbot which users affirmatively gave\ntheir assent to share publicly for research purposes. 19 Appendix B provides detail on our validation\napproach and performance relative to human judgment. For additional transparency, we classify\na sample of 100,000 public WildChat messages and provide those data in this paper’s replication\npackage.\n3.3 Employment Dataset\nWe conduct limited analyses of aggregated employment categories based on publicly available data\nfor a sample of consumer ChatGPT users. This sample included approximately 130,000 Free, Plus,\nand Pro users, and the employment categories were aggregated by a vendor working through a secure\nData Clean Room (DCR). For this analysis, we use the same exclusion criteria as for the message-level\ndatasets: we exclude deactivated users, banned users, users who have opted out of training, and users\nwhose self-reported age is under 18. Because the data was only available for a subset of users the\nresults may not be representative of the full pool of users.\nDescription.The employment data, which is aggregated from publicly available sources, includes\nindustry, occupations coarsened to O*NET categories, seniority level, company size, and education\ninformation that is limited to the degree attained. A vendor working within a DCR procured this\ndataset, restricted us to running only aggregated queries against it through the DCR, and deleted it\nupon the study’s completion.\nPrivacy via a Data Clean Room.We never directly accessed user-level demographic records.\nAll analysis of employment data was executed exclusively within a secure DCR that permits only\npre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or\nexport the other party’s underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute\nany query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a\ncommittee of 6 coauthors and then submitted the notebook to our data partner for approval; only\napproved notebooks could run in the DCR (see Figure 2).\nOur partner enforced strict aggregation limits: they only approved code that returned cells meeting\na threshold of 100 users. Consequently, no individual rows or narrowly defined categories were ever\nvisible to researchers. For example, if 99 users had the occupation “anesthesiologist,” any occupation-\nlevel output would place those users into a “suppressed” category, or place these observations in a\ncoarsened category (e.g. “medical professionals”) rather than reporting a separate cell of anesthesiol-\nogists.\n19The dataset was collected from a third party chatbot using OpenAI’s LLMs via their API.\n8\x0cFigure 2:Illustration of Aggregated Employment Category Analysis via a Data Clean Room. All queries run\nin the Data Clean Room must be approved by our data partner, enforcing a strict aggregation threshold (100\nobservations). As a result, researchers cannot access user-level employment data, only aggregated employment\ncategories.\n3.4 Summarizing Our Approach to Privacy\nWe took measures to safeguard user privacy at every stage of analysis. To summarize, the key elements\nof our approach are:\nAutomated classification of messages.In the course of analysis, no one ever looked directly\nat the content of user messages: all of our analysis of the content of user messages is done\nthrough output of automated classifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed usage data.\nAggregated employment data via a data clean room.We analyze and report aggregated\nemployment data through a secure data clean room environment: no one on the research\nteam had direct access to user-level demographic data and none of our analyses report\naggregates for groups with less than 100 users.\nIn following these measures, we aim to match or exceed the privacy protection precedents set by\nother social scientists studying chatbots and those linking digital platform data to external sources.\nWe follow the precedent established in recent analyses of chatbot conversations (Phang et al.\n(2025), Eloundou et al. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)) that rely on automated\nclassification rather than human inspection of raw transcripts. In particular, Phang et al. (2025)’s\nstudy of affective use of ChatGPT and Eloundou et al. (2025) investigation of first-person fairness in\nchatbots both analyze ChatGPT message content via automated classifiers and emphasize classifier-\nbased labeling as a scalable, privacy-preserving approach. Anthropic’s Handa et al. (2025) used a\nsimilar approach: theirCliomethodology applies automated classifiers to large collections of conver-\nsations, classifying conversations into thousands of topics, and in their appendix they describe manual\nvalidation on sampled conversations (100 user conversations flagged for review and 100 randomly sam-\npled calibrations). Like Eloundou et al., we validate our classifiers using WildChat, a public dataset\nof user conversations.\n9\x0cOther papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant\nprecedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for exam-\nple, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data.\nChetty et al. (2022) analyze de-identified Facebook friendship graphs and anonymized IRS tax records,\naggregated at the zip code level.\n4 The Growth of ChatGPT\nChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December\n5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active\nusers (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after\none year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than\n700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population. 20\nFigure 3:Weekly active ChatGPT users on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), shown as point-in-time\nsnapshots every six months, November 2022–September 2025.\nFigure 4 presents growth in the total messages sent by users over time. The solid line shows that\nbetween July 2024 and July 2025, the number of messages sent grew by a factor of more than 5.\nFigure 4 also shows the contribution of individual cohorts of users to aggregate message volume.\nThe yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over\n2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been. The pink line\nrepresents messages from users who signed up in Q3 of 2023 or earlier, and so thedifferencebetween\n20Note that we expect our counts of distinct accounts to somewhat exceed distinct people when one person has two\naccounts (or, for logged-out users, one person using two devices). For logged-in users, the count is based on distinct\nlogin credentials (email addresses), and one person may have multiple accounts. For logged-out users, the count is based\non distinct browser cookies; this would double-count people if someone returns to ChatGPT after clearing their cookies,\nor if they access ChatGPT with two different devices in the same week.\n10\x0cFigure 4:Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of\nthe requesting user. Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days. Y-axis is an index normalized\nto the reported value for ”All Cohorts” at the end of Q1 2024 (April 1, 2024).\nthe yellow and pink lines represents the messages sent by users who signed up in Q2 and Q3 of 2023.\nThere has been dramatic growth in message volume both by new cohorts of users, and from growth\nin existing cohorts.\nFigure 5 normalizes each cohort, plotting daily messages per weekly active user. Each line rep-\nresents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that\nearlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within\nevery cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,\nand (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.\n5 How ChatGPT is Used\nWe next report on thecontentof ChatGPT conversations using a variety of different taxonomies. For\neach taxonomy we describe a “prompt” which defines a set of categories, and then apply an LLM\nto map each message to a category. Our categories often apply to the user’sintention, rather than\nthe text of the conversation, and as such we never directly observe the ground truth. Nevertheless\nthe classifier results can be interpreted as the best-guess inferences that a human would make: the\nguesses from the LLM correlate highly with human guesses from the same prompt, and we get similar\nqualitative results when the prompt includes a third category for “uncertain.”\n11\x0cFigure 5:Daily messages sent per weekly active user, split by sign-up cohort. Sample only considers users of\nChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro). Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days and are\nreported starting 90 days after the cohort is fully formed. Y-axis is an index normalized to the first reported\nvalue for the Q1 2023 cohort.\n5.1 What share of ChatGPT queries are related to paid work?\nWe label each user message in our dataset based on whether it appears to be related to work, using\nan LLM classifier. The critical part of the prompt is as follows: 21\nDoes the last user message of this conversation transcript seem likely to be related to doing\nsome work/employment? Answer with one of the following:\n(1) likely part of work (e.g., “rewrite this HR complaint”)\n(0) likely not part of work (e.g., “does ice reduce pimples?”)\nTable 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however\nnon-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which\nclimbed to 73% by June 2025.\nFigure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-\nsive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work\nuse has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest\ncohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.\n21See Appendix A for the full prompt, see Appendix B for validation.\n12\x0cFigure 6:The solid black line represents the probability that a messages on a given day is not related to\nwork, as determined by an automated classifier. Values are averaged over a 28-day lagging window. The\ndotted orange line shows the same calculation, but conditioned on messages being from users who first used\nChatGPT during or before Q2 of 2024. The remaining lines are defined similarly for successive quarters, with\ncoloring cooling for more recent cohorts. Counts are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million\nsampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total\nmessage volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n5.2 What are the topics of ChatGPT conversations?\nWe modify a classifier used by internal research teams at OpenAI that identifies which capabilities\nthe user is requesting from ChatGPT. The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation\nTopics arePractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting, collectively accounting for about\n77% of all ChatGPT conversations.Practical Guidancehas remained constant at roughly 29% of\noverall usage.Writinghas declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later.Seeking\nInformationhas grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

Not pictured are twelve other GWAs which\nare less frequently requested and are reported fully in Appendix D. See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between GWA and two-digit SOC2 codes.\n35\x0c7 Conclusion\nThis paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,\nChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more\nthan 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-\ntion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new\ntechnology is used and who is using it.\nThis is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while\nintroducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans\nduring any part of the work on this paper.\nThis paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%\nof ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related\nqueries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.\nSecond, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing,\nandSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro-\ngrammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages\nrespectively.\nThird,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages\noverall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About\ntwo-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text\nfrom scratch.\nFourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we\ncallAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,\nadvice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process\n(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing).Askingmessages have grown\nfaster thanDoingmessages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that\nmeasures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.\nFifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,\nmore than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages\nsent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially\nfast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly\neducated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related\nmessages and forAskingrather thanDoingmessages at work.\nOverall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.\nThe fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI\nusage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to\nbe paid$98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least$97 billion a\nyear. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT\nas an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still,\nChatGPT likely improves worker output by providingdecision support, which is especially important\nin knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making.\n36\x0cReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron, “The Simple Macroeconomics of AI,” Technical Report 32487, National Bureau\nof Economic Research, Cambridge, MA May 2024.\nAutor, David H., Frank Levy, and Richard J.

The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation\nTopics arePractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting, collectively accounting for about\n77% of all ChatGPT conversations.Practical Guidancehas remained constant at roughly 29% of\noverall usage.Writinghas declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later.Seeking\nInformationhas grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

Sampling details\navailable in Section 3.\n15\x0csuggests that most userWritingconversations with ChatGPT are requests to modify user inputs\nrather than to create something new. Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\nmessages and 36% ofPractical Guidancemessages are requests forTutoring or Teaching. Another\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% ofPractical Guidance- is general how-to advice on a variety\nof topics.Technical HelpincludesComputer Programming(4.2% of messages),Mathematical Calcu-\nlations(3%), andData Analysis(0.4%). Looking at the topic ofSelf-Expression, only 2.4% of all\nChatGPT messages are aboutRelationships and Personal Reflection(1.9%) orGames and Role Play\n(0.4%).\nWhile users can seek information and advice from traditional web search engines as well as from\nChatGPT, the ability to produce writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products\ndistinguishes generative AI from existing technologies. ChatGPT is also more flexible than web\nsearch even for traditional applications likeSeeking InformationandPractical Guidance, because\nusers receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy\nfootball team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided\ncontent and follow-up requests.\nFigure 9:Breakdown of granular conversation topic shares within the coarse mapping defined in Table 3. The\nunderlying classifier prompt is available in Appendix A. Each bin reports a percentage of the total population.\nShares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024\nthrough June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day. Sampling\ndetails available in Section 3.\n5.3 User Intent\nExisting studies of the economic impacts of generative AI focus almost exclusively on the potential\nfor AI to perform workplace tasks, either augmenting or automating human labor (e.g. Eloundou et\nal. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)). However, generative AI is a highly flexible\n16\x0ctechnology that can be used in many different ways. In order to learn more about how people seek to\nuse generative AI at work and outside of work, we introduce a classifier that is designed to measure the\ntype of output the user hopes to receive. Specifically, we classify messages according to user intent,\ncoding up conversations according to a simpleAsking, Doing, or Expressingrubric. The critical part\nof our classification prompt is as follows:\nIntent Prompt\nAskingAsking is seeking information or advice that will help the user be better\ninformed or make better decisions, either at work, at school, or in their\npersonal life. (e.g. “Who was president after Lincoln?”, “How do I create a\nbudget for this quarter?”, “What was the inflation rate last year?”,\n“What’s the difference between correlation and causation?”, “What should I\nlook for when choosing a health plan during open enrollment?”).\nDoingDoing messages request that ChatGPT perform tasks for the user. User is\ndrafting an email, writing code, etc. Classify messages as “doing” if they\ninclude requests for output that is created primarily by the model. (e.g.\n“Rewrite this email to make it more formal”, “Draft a report summarizing\nthe use cases of ChatGPT”, “Produce a project timeline with milestones\nand risks in a table”, “Extract companies, people, and dates from this text\ninto CSV.”, “Write a Dockerfile and a minimal docker-compose.yml for\nthis app.”)\nExpressingExpressing statements are neither asking for information, nor for the\nchatbot to perform a task.\nConceptually,Doingconversations are delivering output that can be plugged into a production\nprocess, whileAskingconversations support decision-making but do not produce output directly, and\nExpressingconversations have little or no economic content.\nFigure 10 shows the share of messages by each intent type in our sample. 49% of user messages\nareAsking, 40% areDoing, and 11% areExpressing. The figure also shows the relationship with\nour Topic classification: the two taxonomies are correlated but not redundant:Askingqueries are\nmore likely to bePractical GuidanceandSeeking Information.Doingqueries are disproportionately\nWritingandMultimedia.Expressingqueries are disproportionatelySelf-Expression. However, the\noverlap is imperfect. For example, within thePractical Guidancetopic, anAskingmessage might\nbe advice about how to recover from a sports injury given a user’s personal history, while aDoing\nmessage might request ChatGPT to produce a customized recovery and training plan that could be\nprinted or saved. WithinTechnical Help, anAskingmessage might request help understanding how\nto debug some code, while aDoingmessage might ask ChatGPT to write code for the user directly.\nFigure 11 presents shares ofAsking/Doing/Expressingjust for work-related messages.Doing\nconstitutes nearly 56% of work-related queries, compared to 35% forAskingand 9% forExpressing.\nNearly 35% of all work-related queries areDoingmessages related toWriting.DoingandAsking\ncomprise equal shares ofTechnical Helpqueries.\n17\x0cFigure 10:Breakdown of Conversation Topics by Asking/Doing/Expressing category, with topic columns\nsorted by relative share of ”Doing” messages.

O*NET was developed in partnership with\nthe U.S. Department of Labor and systematically classifies jobs according to the skills, tasks, and\nwork activities required to perform them. O*NET associates each occupation with a set of tasks that\nare performed at different levels of intensity. Each task is then aggregated up to three levels of detail\n- 2,087 detailed work activities (DWAs), 332 intermediate work activities (IWAs), and 41 generalized\nwork activities (GWAs).\nTo understand the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage, we mapped messages to one\nof the 332 O*NET Intermediate Work Activities (IWA), with an additional option ofAmbiguousto\naccount for situations where the user message lacked sufficient context. 22 We then used the official\n22We drew a sample of approximately 1.1 million conversations from May 2024 to June 2025, selected a random\nmessage within each, and classified it according to the prompt in A.\n19\x0cFigure 13:Shares of Asking, Doing, and Expressing messages split by work vs. non-work. See A to review\nthe prompts used by the automated classifiers. The annotations on the right show the shares of work and\nnon-work for the full sample.

We\ndo not show the shares for the following GWAs as there were fewer than 100 users sending messages\nfor each category and group them intoSuppressed.\nFigure 14 presents the share of messages that belong to each GWA, in descending order. Nearly\nhalf of all messages (45.2%) fall under just three GWAs related to information use and manipula-\ntion:Getting Information(19.3%),Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others(13.1%), and\nDocumenting/Recording Information(12.8%). The next most common work activities areProviding\nConsultation and Advice(9.2%),Thinking Creatively(9.1%),Making Decisions and Solving Problems\n(8.5%), andWorking with Computers(4.9%). These seven GWAs collectively account for 76.9% of\nall messages.\nFigure 15 presents the distribution of GWAs for the subsample of messages we classify as work-\nrelated. Among work-related messages, the most common GWAs areDocumenting/Recording In-\nformation(18.4%),Making Decisions and Solving Problems(14.9%),Thinking Creatively(13.0%),\nWorking with Computers(10.8%),Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others(10.1%),Get-\nting Information(9.3%), andProviding Consultation and Advice to Others(4.4%). These seven GWAs\ncollectively account for nearly 81% of work-related messages. Overall, the majority of ChatGPT usage\nat work appears to be focused on two broad functions: 1) obtaining, documenting, and interpreting\ninformation; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems, and thinking creatively.\n20\x0cFigure 14:GWA Shares of 1.1M ChatGPT Messages.

Prompts are provided in the Appendix.\n22\x0c5.5 Quality of Interactions\nWe additionally used automated classifiers to study the user’s apparent satisfaction with the chatbot’s\nresponse to their request. OurInteraction Qualityclassifier looks for an expression of satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction in the user’s subsequent message in the same conversation (if one exists), with three\npossible categories:Good,Bad, andUnknown. 23\nFigure 16 plots the overall growth of messages in these three buckets. In late 2024Goodinteractions\nwere about three times as common asBadinteractions, butGoodinteractions grew much more rapidly\nover the next nine months, and by July 2025 they were more than four times more common.\nFigure 16:Interaction quality shares, based on automated sentiment analysis of thenext responseprovided\nby the user. See Appendix B to understand how this classifier was validated. Values are averaged over a 28\nday lagging window. Shares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations\nfrom May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a\ngiven day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\nDetails on the validation of this classifier, along with measurements of how it correlates with\nexplicit thumbs up/thumbs down annotations from users, are included in Appendix B.\nFigure 17 shows the ratio of good-to-bad messages by conversation topic and interaction type, as\nrated by Interaction Quality. Panel A shows thatSelf-Expressionis the highest rated topic, with a\ngood-to-bad ratio of more than seven, consistent with the growth in this category.Multimediaand\nTechnical Helphave the lowest good-to-bad ratios (1.7 and 2.7 respectively). Panel B shows that\nAskingmessages are substantially more likely to receive a good rating thanDoingorExpressing\nmessages.\n23For this classifier we do not disclose the prompt.\n23\x0cFigure 17:AverageGoodtoBadratio for user interactions by Conversation Topic (Panel A) and Ask-\ning/Doing/Expressing classification (Panel B).

Values represent the average ratio from May 15,\n2024 through June 26, 2025, where observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given\nday. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n24\x0c6 Who Uses ChatGPT\nIn this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work\ndocuments variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in\nthe U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark\n(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently\nby men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.\nWe make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-\ngraphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for\nselected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have\nchanged over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by\neducation and occupation.\n6.1 Name Analysis\nWe investigate potential variation by gender by classifying a global random sample of over 1.1 million\nChatGPT users’ first names using public aggregated datasets of name-gender associations. We used\nthe World Gender Name Dictionary, and Social Security popular names, as well as datasets of popular\nBrazilian and Latin American names. This methodology is similar to that in (Hofstra et al., 2020)\nand (West et al., 2013). Names that were not in these datasets, or were flagged as ambiguous in the\ndatasets, or had significant disagreement amongst these datasets were classified asUnknown.\nExcludingUnknown, a significant share (around 80%) of the weekly active users (WAU) in the\nfirst few months after ChatGPT was released were by users with typically masculine first names.\nHowever, in the first half of 2025, we see the share of active users with typically feminine and typically\nmasculine names reach near-parity. By June 2025 we observe active users are more likely to have\ntypically feminine names. This suggests that gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have closed substantially\nover time.\nWe also study differences in usage topics. Users with typically female first names are relatively more\nlikely to send messages related toWritingandPractical Guidance. ']","['<1-hop>\n\nPanel A.Work Related\n Panel B1.Asking.

"How does ChatGPT Business usage vary by occupation and education level, and what are the most common work-related activities associated with it?","['•Sampled from all ChatGPT users:a random sample of approximately one million de-\nidentified messages from logged-in consumer ChatGPT users between May 2024 and June\n2025.14 This dataset is primarily used in Section 5.\n•Sampled from a subset of ChatGPT users:two random samples of messages sent\nbetween May 2024 and July 2025 by a subset of consumer ChatGPT users (one sample at\nthe conversation level, one sample at the user level). 15 These datasets are primarily used\nin Section 6.\n3.Employment:aggregated employment and education categories based on publicly available\ndata for a subset of consumer ChatGPT users. This data is only used in Section 6.\nWe describe the contents of each dataset, the sampling procedures that produced them, and the\nprivacy protections we implemented in constructing and employing them in analysis.\n3.1 Growth Dataset\nWe compiled a dataset covering all usage on consumer ChatGPT Plans (Free, Plus, Pro) since Chat-\nGPT’s launch in November 2022. We exclude users on non-consumer plans (Business f.k.a. Teams,\n14The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and June 26, 2025.\n15The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and July 31, 2025.\n5\x0cEnterprise, Education).\nFor each user and day, this dataset reports the total number of messages sent by the user on that\nday. It also reports, for each message, de-identified user metadata, including the timestamp of their\nfirst interaction with ChatGPT, the country from which their account is registered, their subscription\nplan on each day, and their self-reported age (reported in coarse 5–7-year buckets to protect user\nprivacy).\n3.2 Classified Messages\nTo understand usage while preserving user privacy, we construct message-level datasets without any\nhuman ever reading the contents of a message. See Figure 1 for an overview of the privacy-preserving\nclassification pipeline. Messages are categorized according to 5 different LLM-based classifiers. The\nclassifiers are introduced in more detail in Section 5, their exact text is reproduced in Appendix A,\nand our validation procedure is described in Appendix B.\nSampled From All ChatGPT Users.We uniformly sampled approximately 1.1 million conver-\nsations, and then sampled one message within each conversation, with the following restrictions:\n1. We only include messages from May 2024 to July 2025.\n2. We exclude conversations from users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training.\n3. We exclude users who self-report their age as under 18.\n4. We exclude conversations that users have deleted and from users whose accounts have been\ndeactivated or banned.\n5. We exclude logged-out users, 16 which represented a minority share of ChatGPT users over the\nsample period.\nOur sample is drawn from a table that is itself sampled, where the sampling rate varied over time.\nWe thus adjust our sampling weights to maintain a fixed ratio with aggregate messages sent.\nSampled From a Subset of ChatGPT Users.We construct two samples of classified messages\nfrom a subset of ChatGPT users (approximately 130,000 users). This sample of users does not include\nany users who opted out of sharing their messages for training, nor does it include users whose self-\nreported age is below 18, nor does it include users who have been banned or deleted their accounts.\nThe first sample contains classifications of 1.58 million messages from this subset of users, sampled\nat the conversation level (a conversation is a series of messages between the user and chatbot). This\nsample is constructed such that the user’s representation in the data is proportional to overall message\nvolume. The second sample contains messages sent from this subset of users, sampled at the user level\nwith up to six messages from each user in the group.\n16ChatGPT became available to logged-out users in April 2024, i.e., users could use ChatGPT without signing up\nfor an account with an email address. However, messages from logged-out users are only available in our dataset from\nMarch 2025, thus for consistency we drop all messages from logged-out users.\n6\x0cFigure 1:Illustration of Privacy-Preserving Automated Classification Pipeline (Synthetic Example). Mes-\nsages are first stripped of PII via an internal LLM-based tool calledPrivacy Filter. Then they are classified by\nLLM-based automated classifiers, described in detail in Appendices A and B. Humans do not see raw messages\nor PII-scrubbed messages, only the final classifications of messages.\nPrivacy via Automated Classifiers.No one looked at the content of messages while conducting\nanalysis for this paper. All analysis of message content was performed via automated LLM-based\nclassifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed message data (see Figure 1). The messages are first\nscrubbed of PII using an internal LLM-based tool,17 and then classified according to classifiers defined\nover a controlled label space—the most precise classifier we use on the message-level data set is the\nO*NET Intermediate Work Activities taxonomy, which we augment to end up with 333 categories.\nWe introduce technical and procedural frictions that prevent accidental access to the underlying text\n(for example, interfaces that do not render message text to researchers).\nOur classifications aim to discern the intent of a given message, and thus we include the prior 10\nmessages in a conversation as context. 18 For an example, see Table 2.\nStand-Alone Message Message with Prior Context\n[user]: “10 more” [user]: “give me 3 cultural activities to do with teens”\n[assistant]: “1. Visit a museum . . . ” (truncated)\n[user]: “10 more”\nTable 2:Illustration of Context-Augmented Message Classifications (Synthetic Example). The left column\nshows a standalone message to be classified, and the right column shows the prior context included in the\nclassification of the message on the left.\nWe truncate each message to a maximum of 5,000 characters, because long context windows could\ninduce variability in the quality of the classification (Liu et al., 2023). We classify each message\nwith the “gpt-5-mini” model, with the exception ofInteraction Quality,which uses “gpt-5,” using the\nprompts listed in Appendix A.\n17Internal analyses show that the tool,Privacy Filter, has substantial alignment with human judgment.\n18In the case ofInteraction Quality,we additionally include the next two messages in the conversation as context.\n7\x0cWe validated each of the classification prompts by comparing model classification decisions against\nhuman-judged classifications of a sample of conversations from the publicly available WildChat dataset\n(Zhao et al., 2024), a set of conversations with a third-party chatbot which users affirmatively gave\ntheir assent to share publicly for research purposes. 19 Appendix B provides detail on our validation\napproach and performance relative to human judgment. For additional transparency, we classify\na sample of 100,000 public WildChat messages and provide those data in this paper’s replication\npackage.\n3.3 Employment Dataset\nWe conduct limited analyses of aggregated employment categories based on publicly available data\nfor a sample of consumer ChatGPT users. This sample included approximately 130,000 Free, Plus,\nand Pro users, and the employment categories were aggregated by a vendor working through a secure\nData Clean Room (DCR). For this analysis, we use the same exclusion criteria as for the message-level\ndatasets: we exclude deactivated users, banned users, users who have opted out of training, and users\nwhose self-reported age is under 18. Because the data was only available for a subset of users the\nresults may not be representative of the full pool of users.\nDescription.The employment data, which is aggregated from publicly available sources, includes\nindustry, occupations coarsened to O*NET categories, seniority level, company size, and education\ninformation that is limited to the degree attained. A vendor working within a DCR procured this\ndataset, restricted us to running only aggregated queries against it through the DCR, and deleted it\nupon the study’s completion.\nPrivacy via a Data Clean Room.We never directly accessed user-level demographic records.\nAll analysis of employment data was executed exclusively within a secure DCR that permits only\npre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or\nexport the other party’s underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute\nany query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a\ncommittee of 6 coauthors and then submitted the notebook to our data partner for approval; only\napproved notebooks could run in the DCR (see Figure 2).\nOur partner enforced strict aggregation limits: they only approved code that returned cells meeting\na threshold of 100 users. Consequently, no individual rows or narrowly defined categories were ever\nvisible to researchers. For example, if 99 users had the occupation “anesthesiologist,” any occupation-\nlevel output would place those users into a “suppressed” category, or place these observations in a\ncoarsened category (e.g. “medical professionals”) rather than reporting a separate cell of anesthesiol-\nogists.\n19The dataset was collected from a third party chatbot using OpenAI’s LLMs via their API.\n8\x0cFigure 2:Illustration of Aggregated Employment Category Analysis via a Data Clean Room. All queries run\nin the Data Clean Room must be approved by our data partner, enforcing a strict aggregation threshold (100\nobservations). As a result, researchers cannot access user-level employment data, only aggregated employment\ncategories.\n3.4 Summarizing Our Approach to Privacy\nWe took measures to safeguard user privacy at every stage of analysis. To summarize, the key elements\nof our approach are:\nAutomated classification of messages.In the course of analysis, no one ever looked directly\nat the content of user messages: all of our analysis of the content of user messages is done\nthrough output of automated classifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed usage data.\nAggregated employment data via a data clean room.We analyze and report aggregated\nemployment data through a secure data clean room environment: no one on the research\nteam had direct access to user-level demographic data and none of our analyses report\naggregates for groups with less than 100 users.\nIn following these measures, we aim to match or exceed the privacy protection precedents set by\nother social scientists studying chatbots and those linking digital platform data to external sources.\nWe follow the precedent established in recent analyses of chatbot conversations (Phang et al.\n(2025), Eloundou et al. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)) that rely on automated\nclassification rather than human inspection of raw transcripts. In particular, Phang et al. (2025)’s\nstudy of affective use of ChatGPT and Eloundou et al. (2025) investigation of first-person fairness in\nchatbots both analyze ChatGPT message content via automated classifiers and emphasize classifier-\nbased labeling as a scalable, privacy-preserving approach. Anthropic’s Handa et al. (2025) used a\nsimilar approach: theirCliomethodology applies automated classifiers to large collections of conver-\nsations, classifying conversations into thousands of topics, and in their appendix they describe manual\nvalidation on sampled conversations (100 user conversations flagged for review and 100 randomly sam-\npled calibrations). Like Eloundou et al., we validate our classifiers using WildChat, a public dataset\nof user conversations.\n9\x0cOther papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant\nprecedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for exam-\nple, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data.\nChetty et al. (2022) analyze de-identified Facebook friendship graphs and anonymized IRS tax records,\naggregated at the zip code level.\n4 The Growth of ChatGPT\nChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December\n5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active\nusers (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after\none year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than\n700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population. 20\nFigure 3:Weekly active ChatGPT users on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), shown as point-in-time\nsnapshots every six months, November 2022–September 2025.\nFigure 4 presents growth in the total messages sent by users over time. The solid line shows that\nbetween July 2024 and July 2025, the number of messages sent grew by a factor of more than 5.\nFigure 4 also shows the contribution of individual cohorts of users to aggregate message volume.\nThe yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over\n2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been. The pink line\nrepresents messages from users who signed up in Q3 of 2023 or earlier, and so thedifferencebetween\n20Note that we expect our counts of distinct accounts to somewhat exceed distinct people when one person has two\naccounts (or, for logged-out users, one person using two devices). For logged-in users, the count is based on distinct\nlogin credentials (email addresses), and one person may have multiple accounts. For logged-out users, the count is based\non distinct browser cookies; this would double-count people if someone returns to ChatGPT after clearing their cookies,\nor if they access ChatGPT with two different devices in the same week.\n10\x0cFigure 4:Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of\nthe requesting user. Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days. Y-axis is an index normalized\nto the reported value for ”All Cohorts” at the end of Q1 2024 (April 1, 2024).\nthe yellow and pink lines represents the messages sent by users who signed up in Q2 and Q3 of 2023.\nThere has been dramatic growth in message volume both by new cohorts of users, and from growth\nin existing cohorts.\nFigure 5 normalizes each cohort, plotting daily messages per weekly active user. Each line rep-\nresents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that\nearlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within\nevery cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,\nand (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.\n5 How ChatGPT is Used\nWe next report on thecontentof ChatGPT conversations using a variety of different taxonomies. For\neach taxonomy we describe a “prompt” which defines a set of categories, and then apply an LLM\nto map each message to a category. Our categories often apply to the user’sintention, rather than\nthe text of the conversation, and as such we never directly observe the ground truth. Nevertheless\nthe classifier results can be interpreted as the best-guess inferences that a human would make: the\nguesses from the LLM correlate highly with human guesses from the same prompt, and we get similar\nqualitative results when the prompt includes a third category for “uncertain.”\n11\x0cFigure 5:Daily messages sent per weekly active user, split by sign-up cohort. Sample only considers users of\nChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro). Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days and are\nreported starting 90 days after the cohort is fully formed. Y-axis is an index normalized to the first reported\nvalue for the Q1 2023 cohort.\n5.1 What share of ChatGPT queries are related to paid work?\nWe label each user message in our dataset based on whether it appears to be related to work, using\nan LLM classifier. The critical part of the prompt is as follows: 21\nDoes the last user message of this conversation transcript seem likely to be related to doing\nsome work/employment? Answer with one of the following:\n(1) likely part of work (e.g., “rewrite this HR complaint”)\n(0) likely not part of work (e.g., “does ice reduce pimples?”)\nTable 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however\nnon-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which\nclimbed to 73% by June 2025.\nFigure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-\nsive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work\nuse has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest\ncohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.\n21See Appendix A for the full prompt, see Appendix B for validation.\n12\x0cFigure 6:The solid black line represents the probability that a messages on a given day is not related to\nwork, as determined by an automated classifier. Values are averaged over a 28-day lagging window. The\ndotted orange line shows the same calculation, but conditioned on messages being from users who first used\nChatGPT during or before Q2 of 2024. The remaining lines are defined similarly for successive quarters, with\ncoloring cooling for more recent cohorts. Counts are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million\nsampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total\nmessage volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n5.2 What are the topics of ChatGPT conversations?\nWe modify a classifier used by internal research teams at OpenAI that identifies which capabilities\nthe user is requesting from ChatGPT. The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation\nTopics arePractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting, collectively accounting for about\n77% of all ChatGPT conversations.Practical Guidancehas remained constant at roughly 29% of\noverall usage.Writinghas declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later.Seeking\nInformationhas grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between GWA and two-digit SOC2 codes.\n35\x0c7 Conclusion\nThis paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,\nChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more\nthan 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-\ntion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new\ntechnology is used and who is using it.\nThis is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while\nintroducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans\nduring any part of the work on this paper.\nThis paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%\nof ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related\nqueries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.\nSecond, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing,\nandSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro-\ngrammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages\nrespectively.\nThird,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages\noverall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About\ntwo-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text\nfrom scratch.\nFourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we\ncallAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,\nadvice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process\n(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing).Askingmessages have grown\nfaster thanDoingmessages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that\nmeasures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.\nFifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,\nmore than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages\nsent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially\nfast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly\neducated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related\nmessages and forAskingrather thanDoingmessages at work.\nOverall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.\nThe fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI\nusage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to\nbe paid$98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least$97 billion a\nyear. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT\nas an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still,\nChatGPT likely improves worker output by providingdecision support, which is especially important\nin knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making.\n36\x0cReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron, “The Simple Macroeconomics of AI,” Technical Report 32487, National Bureau\nof Economic Research, Cambridge, MA May 2024.\nAutor, David H., Frank Levy, and Richard J.

The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation\nTopics arePractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting, collectively accounting for about\n77% of all ChatGPT conversations.Practical Guidancehas remained constant at roughly 29% of\noverall usage.Writinghas declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later.Seeking\nInformationhas grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

Sampling details\navailable in Section 3.\n15\x0csuggests that most userWritingconversations with ChatGPT are requests to modify user inputs\nrather than to create something new. Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\nmessages and 36% ofPractical Guidancemessages are requests forTutoring or Teaching. Another\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% ofPractical Guidance- is general how-to advice on a variety\nof topics.Technical HelpincludesComputer Programming(4.2% of messages),Mathematical Calcu-\nlations(3%), andData Analysis(0.4%). Looking at the topic ofSelf-Expression, only 2.4% of all\nChatGPT messages are aboutRelationships and Personal Reflection(1.9%) orGames and Role Play\n(0.4%).\nWhile users can seek information and advice from traditional web search engines as well as from\nChatGPT, the ability to produce writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products\ndistinguishes generative AI from existing technologies. ChatGPT is also more flexible than web\nsearch even for traditional applications likeSeeking InformationandPractical Guidance, because\nusers receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy\nfootball team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided\ncontent and follow-up requests.\nFigure 9:Breakdown of granular conversation topic shares within the coarse mapping defined in Table 3. The\nunderlying classifier prompt is available in Appendix A. Each bin reports a percentage of the total population.\nShares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024\nthrough June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day. Sampling\ndetails available in Section 3.\n5.3 User Intent\nExisting studies of the economic impacts of generative AI focus almost exclusively on the potential\nfor AI to perform workplace tasks, either augmenting or automating human labor (e.g. Eloundou et\nal. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)). However, generative AI is a highly flexible\n16\x0ctechnology that can be used in many different ways. In order to learn more about how people seek to\nuse generative AI at work and outside of work, we introduce a classifier that is designed to measure the\ntype of output the user hopes to receive. Specifically, we classify messages according to user intent,\ncoding up conversations according to a simpleAsking, Doing, or Expressingrubric. The critical part\nof our classification prompt is as follows:\nIntent Prompt\nAskingAsking is seeking information or advice that will help the user be better\ninformed or make better decisions, either at work, at school, or in their\npersonal life. (e.g. “Who was president after Lincoln?”, “How do I create a\nbudget for this quarter?”, “What was the inflation rate last year?”,\n“What’s the difference between correlation and causation?”, “What should I\nlook for when choosing a health plan during open enrollment?”).\nDoingDoing messages request that ChatGPT perform tasks for the user. User is\ndrafting an email, writing code, etc. Classify messages as “doing” if they\ninclude requests for output that is created primarily by the model. (e.g.\n“Rewrite this email to make it more formal”, “Draft a report summarizing\nthe use cases of ChatGPT”, “Produce a project timeline with milestones\nand risks in a table”, “Extract companies, people, and dates from this text\ninto CSV.”, “Write a Dockerfile and a minimal docker-compose.yml for\nthis app.”)\nExpressingExpressing statements are neither asking for information, nor for the\nchatbot to perform a task.\nConceptually,Doingconversations are delivering output that can be plugged into a production\nprocess, whileAskingconversations support decision-making but do not produce output directly, and\nExpressingconversations have little or no economic content.\nFigure 10 shows the share of messages by each intent type in our sample. 49% of user messages\nareAsking, 40% areDoing, and 11% areExpressing. The figure also shows the relationship with\nour Topic classification: the two taxonomies are correlated but not redundant:Askingqueries are\nmore likely to bePractical GuidanceandSeeking Information.Doingqueries are disproportionately\nWritingandMultimedia.Expressingqueries are disproportionatelySelf-Expression. However, the\noverlap is imperfect. For example, within thePractical Guidancetopic, anAskingmessage might\nbe advice about how to recover from a sports injury given a user’s personal history, while aDoing\nmessage might request ChatGPT to produce a customized recovery and training plan that could be\nprinted or saved.

O*NET was developed in partnership with\nthe U.S. Department of Labor and systematically classifies jobs according to the skills, tasks, and\nwork activities required to perform them. O*NET associates each occupation with a set of tasks that\nare performed at different levels of intensity. Each task is then aggregated up to three levels of detail\n- 2,087 detailed work activities (DWAs), 332 intermediate work activities (IWAs), and 41 generalized\nwork activities (GWAs).\nTo understand the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage, we mapped messages to one\nof the 332 O*NET Intermediate Work Activities (IWA), with an additional option ofAmbiguousto\naccount for situations where the user message lacked sufficient context. 22 We then used the official\n22We drew a sample of approximately 1.1 million conversations from May 2024 to June 2025, selected a random\nmessage within each, and classified it according to the prompt in A.\n19\x0cFigure 13:Shares of Asking, Doing, and Expressing messages split by work vs. non-work.

We\ndo not show the shares for the following GWAs as there were fewer than 100 users sending messages\nfor each category and group them intoSuppressed.\nFigure 14 presents the share of messages that belong to each GWA, in descending order. Nearly\nhalf of all messages (45.2%) fall under just three GWAs related to information use and manipula-\ntion:Getting Information(19.3%),Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others(13.1%), and\nDocumenting/Recording Information(12.8%). The next most common work activities areProviding\nConsultation and Advice(9.2%),Thinking Creatively(9.1%),Making Decisions and Solving Problems\n(8.5%), andWorking with Computers(4.9%). These seven GWAs collectively account for 76.9% of\nall messages.\nFigure 15 presents the distribution of GWAs for the subsample of messages we classify as work-\nrelated. Among work-related messages, the most common GWAs areDocumenting/Recording In-\nformation(18.4%),Making Decisions and Solving Problems(14.9%),Thinking Creatively(13.0%),\nWorking with Computers(10.8%),Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others(10.1%),Get-\nting Information(9.3%), andProviding Consultation and Advice to Others(4.4%). These seven GWAs\ncollectively account for nearly 81% of work-related messages. Overall, the majority of ChatGPT usage\nat work appears to be focused on two broad functions: 1) obtaining, documenting, and interpreting\ninformation; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems, and thinking creatively.\n20\x0cFigure 14:GWA Shares of 1.1M ChatGPT Messages.

OurInteraction Qualityclassifier looks for an expression of satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction in the user’s subsequent message in the same conversation (if one exists), with three\npossible categories:Good,Bad, andUnknown. 23\nFigure 16 plots the overall growth of messages in these three buckets. In late 2024Goodinteractions\nwere about three times as common asBadinteractions, butGoodinteractions grew much more rapidly\nover the next nine months, and by July 2025 they were more than four times more common.\nFigure 16:Interaction quality shares, based on automated sentiment analysis of thenext responseprovided\nby the user.

Sampling details available in Section 3.\n24\x0c6 Who Uses ChatGPT\nIn this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work\ndocuments variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in\nthe U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark\n(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently\nby men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.\nWe make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-\ngraphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for\nselected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have\nchanged over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by\neducation and occupation.\n6.1 Name Analysis\nWe investigate potential variation by gender by classifying a global random sample of over 1.1 million\nChatGPT users’ first names using public aggregated datasets of name-gender associations. We used\nthe World Gender Name Dictionary, and Social Security popular names, as well as datasets of popular\nBrazilian and Latin American names. This methodology is similar to that in (Hofstra et al., 2020)\nand (West et al., 2013). Names that were not in these datasets, or were flagged as ambiguous in the\ndatasets, or had significant disagreement amongst these datasets were classified asUnknown.\nExcludingUnknown, a significant share (around 80%) of the weekly active users (WAU) in the\nfirst few months after ChatGPT was released were by users with typically masculine first names.\nHowever, in the first half of 2025, we see the share of active users with typically feminine and typically\nmasculine names reach near-parity. By June 2025 we observe active users are more likely to have\ntypically feminine names. This suggests that gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have closed substantially\nover time.\nWe also study differences in usage topics. Users with typically female first names are relatively more\nlikely to send messages related toWritingandPractical Guidance. ']","['<1-hop>\n\nCorporate users may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise. 28Very few work-related messages are classified asExpressing. 29Appendix D contains a full report of GWA counts broken down by occupation, for both work-related ChatGPT 31 We find remarkable similarity across occupations in how ChatGPT is used at work. For example, Making Decisions and Solving Problemsis one of the two most common GWAs in every single oc- cupation group where at least two GWAs can be reported. 30 Similarly,Documenting and Recording Informationranks in the top four of all occupations.Thinking Creativelyis ranked as the third most common GWA in 10 of the 13 occupation groups where at least three GWAs can be reported. Even though there are 41 GWAs, the seven most common overall are also the most common within each occupation group and are ranked similarly. Not surprisingly,Working with Computersis the most common GWA in computer-related occupations. In the appendix, we report the full distribution of GWA classifications intersected with two-digit SOC codes, as well as the most frequently requested GWAs out of the subset of queries which are work-related. Across all occupations, ChatGPT usage is broadly focused on seeking information and assistance with decision-making. usage and all ChatGPT usage. 30For legal and food service occupations, we are only able to rank one of the GWAs because of user privacy protections - no other GWAs were requested by more than 100 users in that group. 32 Panel A.Work Related Panel B1.Asking.

Table reports the frequency ranking of each of these GWAs for each broad occupation groups (two-digit SOC codes). 1 represents the most frequently requested GWA for that occupation. X’s indicate that the ranking is unavailable since fewer than 100 users from that occupation group requested that specific GWA within the sample. Seven occupation groups are omitted because no GWA was requested by more than 100 users from a single occupation group. These omitted occupation groups (with corresponding SOC2 codes) are ”Healthcare Support” (31), ”Protective Service” (33), ”Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance” (37), ”Farming, Fishing, and Forestry” (45), ”Construction and Extraction” (47), ”Installation, Maintenance, and Repair” (49), and ”Production” (51).

See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between', '<2-hop>\n\nFigure 22:Variation in ChatGPT usage by education. Each plot shows unadjusted vs. regression-adjusted estimates, with 95% confidence intervals. We regress each message share on education and occupation, control- ling for the following covariates: age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, seniority within role, company size, and industry. (To guarantee user privacy, we coarsen all covariates to broad categories and programmatically enforce that each group has at least 100 members prior to running the regression) We add the coefficients on each education and occupation category to the unadjusted value for the reference category and compute 95% confidence intervals using the standard errors from the regression coefficients. The sample for this regression is the approximately 40,000 users of the original 130,000 sample whose publicly available occupation was not blank or consisted of strictly special characters (as determined by a classification script). Shares for each user are calculated by randomly sampling up to six conversations attributed to the user from May 2024 through July 2025. 30 6.5 Variation by Occupation Figure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation. Due to privacy-preserving aggre- gation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories – (1) all nonprofessional occupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computer- related occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupa- tions; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care. 26 As above, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents the coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size, and industry. Users in highly paid professional and technical occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work.27 Panel A shows that the unadjusted work shares are 57% for computer-related occupations; 50% for management and business; 48% for engineering and science; 44% for other professional oc- cupations; and only 40% for all non-professional occupations. Regression adjustment moves these figures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in highly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages. Because work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related messages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that areAsking messages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT forAskingrather thanDoing. 28 This is especially true in scientific and technical occupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupa- tions areAskingmessages, compared to only 32% for non-professional occupations. These differences shrink somewhat with regression adjustment, but remain highly statistically significant. Panel C presents results by conversation topic.Writingis especially common for users employed in management and business occupations, accounting for 52% of all work-related messages. Writing is also relatively common in non-professional and other professional occupations like education and health care, accounting for 50% and 49% of work-related messages respectively.Technical Helpconsti- tutes 37% of all work-related messages for users employed in computer-related occupations, compared to 16% in engineering and science and only about 8% for all other categories. Regression adjustment affects gaps by occupation only modestly. Overall there are stark differences in the distribution of conversation topics by user occupation, with work-related messages clearly focused on the core tasks in each job (e.g.Writingfor management and business,Technical Helpfor technical occupations). We also present data on the most common Generalized Work Activities (GWAs) associated with each broad occupation group, as measured by 2-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes. Table 24 presents the frequency ranking of work-related messages in each SOC code of the seven most common GWAs.29 26Management and business are SOC2 codes 11 and 13. Computer-related is SOC2 code 15. Engineering and Science are SOC2 codes 17 and 19. Other Professional are SOC2 codes 21 to 29. Nonprofessional occupations are SOC codes 31 to 53. 27As discussed in Section: Data and Privacy, our dataset only includes users on ChatGPT Consumer plans. Corporate users may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise. 28Very few work-related messages']",I don't have enough information to answer.,"ChatGPT Business usage varies significantly by occupation and education level. Users in highly paid professional occupations, such as management and business, are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related tasks. For instance, 50% of work-related messages come from management and business occupations, while only 40% come from non-professional occupations. The most common work-related activities associated with ChatGPT usage include Documenting and Recording Information, Making Decisions and Solving Problems, and Thinking Creatively. These activities rank similarly across various occupation groups, indicating a broad focus on seeking information and assistance with decision-making in the workplace.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0999999999,0.0
How does the environmental impact of artificial intelligence relate to the concerns about its ethical implications and energy consumption?,"['What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\nWhat is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\nWhat is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\nWhy is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\nAre there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU\'s Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections. It bans some AI use altogether.\nGenerative AI developers in China are required to safeguard citizens\' data, and promote transparency and accuracy of information. But they are also bound by the country\'s strict censorship laws.\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the government ""will test and understand AI before we regulate it"".\nBoth the UK and US have AI Safety Institutes that aim to identify risks and evaluate advanced AI models.\nIn 2024 the two countries signed an agreement to collaborate on developing ""robust"" AI testing methods.\nHowever, in February 2025, neither country signed an international AI declaration which pledged an open, inclusive and sustainable approach to the technology.\nSeveral countries including the UK are also clamping down on use of AI systems to create deepfake nude imagery and child sexual abuse material.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world\'s top tech stories and trends.

As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.1 A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.\nDespite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIn this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2\nIn order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward:\n- Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users’ personal privacy,\n- invest more government funding in unclassified AI research,\n- promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy,\n- create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations,\n- engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies,\n- regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms,\n- take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms,\n- maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and\n- penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.\nQualities of artificial intelligence\nAlthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.\nIntentionality\nArtificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data. They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses. Using sensors, digital data, or remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those data. With massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, and analytic techniques, they are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decisionmaking.\nArtificial intelligence is already altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIntelligence\nAI generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics.5 Machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends. If it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues. All that is required are data that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern useful patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.\nAdaptability\nAI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. In the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.\nApplications in diverse sectors\nAI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors. This includes fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.6\nOne of the reasons for the growing role of AI is the tremendous opportunities for economic development that it presents. A project undertaken by PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated that “artificial intelligence technologies could increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion, a full 14%, by 2030.”7 That includes advances of $7 trillion in China, $3.7 trillion in North America, $1.8 trillion in Northern Europe, $1.2 trillion for Africa and Oceania, $0.9 trillion in the rest of Asia outside of China, $0.7 trillion in Southern Europe, and $0.5 trillion in Latin America. China is making rapid strides because it has set a national goal of investing $150 billion in AI and becoming the global leader in this area by 2030.\nMeanwhile, a McKinsey Global Institute study of China found that “AI-led automation can give the Chinese economy a productivity injection that would add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth annually, depending on the speed of adoption.”8 Although its authors found that China currently lags the United States and the United Kingdom in AI deployment, the sheer size of its AI market gives that country tremendous opportunities for pilot testing and future development.\nFinance\nInvestments in financial AI in the United States tripled between 2013 and 2014 to a total of $12.2 billion.9 According to observers in that sector, “Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check.”10 In addition, there are so-called robo-advisers that “create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers.”11 These advances are designed to take the emotion out of investing and undertake decisions based on analytical considerations, and make these choices in a matter of minutes.\nA prominent example of this is taking place in stock exchanges, where high-frequency trading by machines has replaced much of human decisionmaking. People submit buy and sell orders, and computers match them in the blink of an eye without human intervention. Machines can spot trading inefficiencies or market differentials on a very small scale and execute trades that make money according to investor instructions.12 Powered in some places by advanced computing, these tools have much greater capacities for storing information because of their emphasis not on a zero or a one, but on “quantum bits” that can store multiple values in each location.13 That dramatically increases storage capacity and decreases processing times.\nFraud detection represents another way AI is helpful in financial systems. It sometimes is difficult to discern fraudulent activities in large organizations, but AI can identify abnormalities, outliers, or deviant cases requiring additional investigation. That helps managers find problems early in the cycle, before they reach dangerous levels.14\nNational security\nAI plays a substantial role in national defense. Through its Project Maven, the American military is deploying AI “to sift through the massive troves of data and video captured by surveillance and then alert human analysts of patterns or when there is abnormal or suspicious activity.”15 According to Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, the goal of emerging technologies in this area is “to meet our warfighters’ needs and to increase [the] speed and agility [of] technology development and procurement.”16\nArtificial intelligence will accelerate the traditional process of warfare so rapidly that a new term has been coined: hyperwar.\nThe big data analytics associated with AI will profoundly affect intelligence analysis, as massive amounts of data are sifted in near real time—if not eventually in real time—thereby providing commanders and their staffs a level of intelligence analysis and productivity heretofore unseen. Command and control will similarly be affected as human commanders delegate certain routine, and in special circumstances, key decisions to AI platforms, reducing dramatically the time associated with the decision and subsequent action. In the end, warfare is a time competitive process, where the side able to decide the fastest and move most quickly to execution will generally prevail. Indeed, artificially intelligent intelligence systems, tied to AI-assisted command and control systems, can move decision support and decisionmaking to a speed vastly superior to the speeds of the traditional means of waging war. So fast will be this process, especially if coupled to automatic decisions to launch artificially intelligent autonomous weapons systems capable of lethal outcomes, that a new term has been coined specifically to embrace the speed at which war will be waged: hyperwar.\nWhile the ethical and legal debate is raging over whether America will ever wage war with artificially intelligent autonomous lethal systems, the Chinese and Russians are not nearly so mired in this debate, and we should anticipate our need to defend against these systems operating at hyperwar speeds. The challenge in the West of where to position “humans in the loop” in a hyperwar scenario will ultimately dictate the West’s capacity to be competitive in this new form of conflict.17\nJust as AI will profoundly affect the speed of warfare, the proliferation of zero day or zero second cyber threats as well as polymorphic malware will challenge even the most sophisticated signature-based cyber protection. This forces significant improvement to existing cyber defenses. Increasingly, vulnerable systems are migrating, and will need to shift to a layered approach to cybersecurity with cloud-based, cognitive AI platforms. This approach moves the community toward a “thinking” defensive capability that can defend networks through constant training on known threats. This capability includes DNA-level analysis of heretofore unknown code, with the possibility of recognizing and stopping inbound malicious code by recognizing a string component of the file. This is how certain key U.S.-based systems stopped the debilitating “WannaCry” and “Petya” viruses.\nPreparing for hyperwar and defending critical cyber networks must become a high priority because China, Russia, North Korea, and other countries are putting substantial resources into AI. In 2017, China’s State Council issued a plan for the country to “build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion” by 2030.18 As an example of the possibilities, the Chinese search firm Baidu has pioneered a facial recognition application that finds missing people. In addition, cities such as Shenzhen are providing up to $1 million to support AI labs. That country hopes AI will provide security, combat terrorism, and improve speech recognition programs.19 The dual-use nature of many AI algorithms will mean AI research focused on one sector of society can be rapidly modified for use in the security sector as well.20\nHealth care\nAI tools are helping designers improve computational sophistication in health care. For example, Merantix is a German company that applies deep learning to medical issues. It has an application in medical imaging that “detects lymph nodes in the human body in Computer Tomography (CT) images.”21 According to its developers, the key is labeling the nodes and identifying small lesions or growths that could be problematic. Humans can do this, but radiologists charge $100 per hour and may be able to carefully read only four images an hour. If there were 10,000 images, the cost of this process would be $250,000, which is prohibitively expensive if done by humans.\nWhat deep learning can do in this situation is train computers on data sets to learn what a normal-looking versus an irregular-appearing lymph node is. After doing that through imaging exercises and honing the accuracy of the labeling, radiological imaging specialists can apply this knowledge to actual patients and determine the extent to which someone is at risk of cancerous lymph nodes. Since only a few are likely to test positive, it is a matter of identifying the unhealthy versus healthy node.\nAI has been applied to congestive heart failure as well, an illness that afflicts 10 percent of senior citizens and costs $35 billion each year in the United States. AI tools are helpful because they “predict in advance potential challenges ahead and allocate resources to patient education, sensing, and proactive interventions that keep patients out of the hospital.”22\nCriminal justice\nAI is being deployed in the criminal justice area. The city of Chicago has developed an AI-driven “Strategic Subject List” that analyzes people who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators. It ranks 400,000 people on a scale of 0 to 500, using items such as age, criminal activity, victimization, drug arrest records, and gang affiliation. In looking at the data, analysts found that youth is a strong predictor of violence, being a shooting victim is associated with becoming a future perpetrator, gang affiliation has little predictive value, and drug arrests are not significantly associated with future criminal activity.23\nJudicial experts claim AI programs reduce human bias in law enforcement and leads to a fairer sentencing system. R Street Institute Associate Caleb Watney writes:\nEmpirically grounded questions of predictive risk analysis play to the strengths of machine learning, automated reasoning and other forms of AI. One machine-learning policy simulation concluded that such programs could be used to cut crime up to 24.8 percent with no change in jailing rates, or reduce jail populations by up to 42 percent with no increase in crime rates.24\nHowever, critics worry that AI algorithms represent “a secret system to punish citizens for crimes they haven’t yet committed. The risk scores have been used numerous times to guide large-scale roundups.”25 The fear is that such tools target people of color unfairly and have not helped Chicago reduce the murder wave that has plagued it in recent years.\nDespite these concerns, other countries are moving ahead with rapid deployment in this area. In China, for example, companies already have “considerable resources and access to voices, faces and other biometric data in vast quantities, which would help them develop their technologies.”26 New technologies make it possible to match images and voices with other types of information, and to use AI on these combined data sets to improve law enforcement and national security. Through its “Sharp Eyes” program, Chinese law enforcement is matching video images, social media activity, online purchases, travel records, and personal identity into a “police cloud.” This integrated database enables authorities to keep track of criminals, potential law-breakers, and terrorists.27 Put differently, China has become the world’s leading AI-powered surveillance state.\nTransportation\nTransportation represents an area where AI and machine learning are producing major innovations. Research by Cameron Kerry and Jack Karsten of the Brookings Institution has found that over $80 billion was invested in autonomous vehicle technology between August 2014 and June 2017. Those investments include applications both for autonomous driving and the core technologies vital to that sector.28\nAutonomous vehicles—cars, trucks, buses, and drone delivery systems—use advanced technological capabilities. Those features include automated vehicle guidance and braking, lane-changing systems, the use of cameras and sensors for collision avoidance, the use of AI to analyze information in real time, and the use of high-performance computing and deep learning systems to adapt to new circumstances through detailed maps.29\nLight detection and ranging systems (LIDARs) and AI are key to navigation and collision avoidance. LIDAR systems combine light and radar instruments. They are mounted on the top of vehicles that use imaging in a 360-degree environment from a radar and light beams to measure the speed and distance of surrounding objects. Along with sensors placed on the front, sides, and back of the vehicle, these instruments provide information that keeps fast-moving cars and trucks in their own lane, helps them avoid other vehicles, applies brakes and steering when needed, and does so instantly so as to avoid accidents.\nAdvanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change. This means that software is the key—not the physical car or truck itself.\nSince these cameras and sensors compile a huge amount of information and need to process it instantly to avoid the car in the next lane, autonomous vehicles require high-performance computing, advanced algorithms, and deep learning systems to adapt to new scenarios. This means that software is the key, not the physical car or truck itself.30 Advanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change.31\nRide-sharing companies are very interested in autonomous vehicles. They see advantages in terms of customer service and labor productivity. All of the major ride-sharing companies are exploring driverless cars. The surge of car-sharing and taxi services—such as Uber and Lyft in the United States, Daimler’s Mytaxi and Hailo service in Great Britain, and Didi Chuxing in China—demonstrate the opportunities of this transportation option. Uber recently signed an agreement to purchase 24,000 autonomous cars from Volvo for its ride-sharing service.32\nHowever, the ride-sharing firm suffered a setback in March 2018 when one of its autonomous vehicles in Arizona hit and killed a pedestrian. Uber and several auto manufacturers immediately suspended testing and launched investigations into what went wrong and how the fatality could have occurred.33 Both industry and consumers want reassurance that the technology is safe and able to deliver on its stated promises. Unless there are persuasive answers, this accident could slow AI advancements in the transportation sector.\nSmart cities\nMetropolitan governments are using AI to improve urban service delivery. For example, according to Kevin Desouza, Rashmi Krishnamurthy, and Gregory Dawson:\nThe Cincinnati Fire Department is using data analytics to optimize medical emergency responses. The new analytics system recommends to the dispatcher an appropriate response to a medical emergency call—whether a patient can be treated on-site or needs to be taken to the hospital—by taking into account several factors, such as the type of call, location, weather, and similar calls.34\nSince it fields 80,000 requests each year, Cincinnati officials are deploying this technology to prioritize responses and determine the best ways to handle emergencies. They see AI as a way to deal with large volumes of data and figure out efficient ways of responding to public requests. Rather than address service issues in an ad hoc manner, authorities are trying to be proactive in how they provide urban services.\nCincinnati is not alone. A number of metropolitan areas are adopting smart city applications that use AI to improve service delivery, environmental planning, resource management, energy utilization, and crime prevention, among other things. For its smart cities index, the magazine Fast Company ranked American locales and found Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City as the top adopters. Seattle, for example, has embraced sustainability and is using AI to manage energy usage and resource management. Boston has launched a “City Hall To Go” that makes sure underserved communities receive needed public services. It also has deployed “cameras and inductive loops to manage traffic and acoustic sensors to identify gun shots.” San Francisco has certified 203 buildings as meeting LEED sustainability standards.35\nThrough these and other means, metropolitan areas are leading the country in the deployment of AI solutions. Indeed, according to a National League of Cities report, 66 percent of American cities are investing in smart city technology. Among the top applications noted in the report are “smart meters for utilities, intelligent traffic signals, e-governance applications, Wi-Fi kiosks, and radio frequency identification sensors in pavement.”36\nPolicy, regulatory, and ethical issues\nThese examples from a variety of sectors demonstrate how AI is transforming many walks of human existence. The increasing penetration of AI and autonomous devices into many aspects of life is altering basic operations and decisionmaking within organizations, and improving efficiency and response times.\nAt the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues. For example, how should we promote data access? How do we guard against biased or unfair data used in algorithms? What types of ethical principles are introduced through software programming, and how transparent should designers be about their choices? What about questions of legal liability in cases where algorithms cause harm?37\nThe increasing penetration of AI into many aspects of life is altering decisionmaking within organizations and improving efficiency. At the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues.\nData access problems\nThe key to getting the most out of AI is having a “data-friendly ecosystem with unified standards and cross-platform sharing.” AI depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought to bear on concrete problems. Having data that are “accessible for exploration” in the research community is a prerequisite for successful AI development.38\nAccording to a McKinsey Global Institute study, nations that promote open data sources and data sharing are the ones most likely to see AI advances. In this regard, the United States has a substantial advantage over China. Global ratings on data openness show that U.S. ranks eighth overall in the world, compared to 93 for China.39\nBut right now, the United States does not have a coherent national data strategy. There are few protocols for promoting research access or platforms that make it possible to gain new insights from proprietary data. It is not always clear who owns data or how much belongs in the public sphere. These uncertainties limit the innovation economy and act as a drag on academic research. In the following section, we outline ways to improve data access for researchers.\nBiases in data and algorithms\nIn some instances, certain AI systems are thought to have enabled discriminatory or biased practices.40 For example, Airbnb has been accused of having homeowners on its platform who discriminate against racial minorities. A research project undertaken by the Harvard Business School found that “Airbnb users with distinctly African American names were roughly 16 percent less likely to be accepted as guests than those with distinctly white names.”41\nRacial issues also come up with facial recognition software. Most such systems operate by comparing a person’s face to a range of faces in a large database. As pointed out by Joy Buolamwini of the Algorithmic Justice League, “If your facial recognition data contains mostly Caucasian faces, that’s what your program will learn to recognize.”42 Unless the databases have access to diverse data, these programs perform poorly when attempting to recognize African-American or Asian-American features.\nMany historical data sets reflect traditional values, which may or may not represent the preferences wanted in a current system. As Buolamwini notes, such an approach risks repeating inequities of the past:\nThe rise of automation and the increased reliance on algorithms for high-stakes decisions such as whether someone get insurance or not, your likelihood to default on a loan or somebody’s risk of recidivism means this is something that needs to be addressed. Even admissions decisions are increasingly automated—what school our children go to and what opportunities they have. We don’t have to bring the structural inequalities of the past into the future we create.43\nAI ethics and transparency\nAlgorithms embed ethical considerations and value choices into program decisions. As such, these systems raise questions concerning the criteria used in automated decisionmaking. Some people want to have a better understanding of how algorithms function and what choices are being made.44\nIn the United States, many urban schools use algorithms for enrollment decisions based on a variety of considerations, such as parent preferences, neighborhood qualities, income level, and demographic background. According to Brookings researcher Jon Valant, the New Orleans–based Bricolage Academy “gives priority to economically disadvantaged applicants for up to 33 percent of available seats. In practice, though, most cities have opted for categories that prioritize siblings of current students, children of school employees, and families that live in school’s broad geographic area.”45 Enrollment choices can be expected to be very different when considerations of this sort come into play.\nDepending on how AI systems are set up, they can facilitate the redlining of mortgage applications, help people discriminate against individuals they don’t like, or help screen or build rosters of individuals based on unfair criteria. The types of considerations that go into programming decisions matter a lot in terms of how the systems operate and how they affect customers.46\nFor these reasons, the EU is implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. The rules specify that people have “the right to opt out of personally tailored ads” and “can contest ‘legal or similarly significant’ decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention” in the form of an explanation of how the algorithm generated a particular outcome. Each guideline is designed to ensure the protection of personal data and provide individuals with information on how the “black box” operates.47\nLegal liability\nThere are questions concerning the legal liability of AI systems. If there are harms or infractions (or fatalities in the case of driverless cars), the operators of the algorithm likely will fall under product liability rules. A body of case law has shown that the situation’s facts and circumstances determine liability and influence the kind of penalties that are imposed. Those can range from civil fines to imprisonment for major harms.48 The Uber-related fatality in Arizona will be an important test case for legal liability. The state actively recruited Uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company considerable latitude in terms of road testing. It remains to be seen if there will be lawsuits in this case and who is sued: the human backup driver, the state of Arizona, the Phoenix suburb where the accident took place, Uber, software developers, or the auto manufacturer. Given the multiple people and organizations involved in the road testing, there are many legal questions to be resolved.\nIn non-transportation areas, digital platforms often have limited liability for what happens on their sites. For example, in the case of Airbnb, the firm “requires that people agree to waive their right to sue, or to join in any class-action lawsuit or class-action arbitration, to use the service.” By demanding that its users sacrifice basic rights, the company limits consumer protections and therefore curtails the ability of people to fight discrimination arising from unfair algorithms.49 But whether the principle of neutral networks holds up in many sectors is yet to be determined on a widespread basis.\nRecommendations\nIn order to balance innovation with basic human values, we propose a number of recommendations for moving forward with AI. This includes improving data access, increasing government investment in AI, promoting AI workforce development, creating a federal advisory committee, engaging with state and local officials to ensure they enact effective policies, regulating broad objectives as opposed to specific algorithms, taking bias seriously as an AI issue, maintaining mechanisms for human control and oversight, and penalizing malicious behavior and promoting cybersecurity.\nImproving data access\nThe United States should develop a data strategy that promotes innovation and consumer protection. Right now, there are no uniform standards in terms of data access, data sharing, or data protection. Almost all the data are proprietary in nature and not shared very broadly with the research community, and this limits innovation and system design. AI requires data to test and improve its learning capacity.50 Without structured and unstructured data sets, it will be nearly impossible to gain the full benefits of artificial intelligence.\nIn general, the research community needs better access to government and business data, although with appropriate safeguards to make sure researchers do not misuse data in the way Cambridge Analytica did with Facebook information. There is a variety of ways researchers could gain data access. ']","['<1-hop>\n\nWhat is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\n What is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\n What is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\n Why is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\n', '<2-hop>\n\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\n Are there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU\'s Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections. It bans some AI use altogether.\nGenerative AI developers in China are required to safeguard citizens\' data, and promote transparency and accuracy of information. But they are also bound by the country\'s strict censorship laws.\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the government ""will test and understand AI before we regulate it"".\nBoth the UK and US have AI Safety Institutes that aim to identify risks and evaluate advanced AI models.\nIn 2024 the two countries signed an agreement to collaborate on developing ""robust"" AI testing methods.\nHowever, in February 2025, neither country signed an international AI declaration which pledged an open, inclusive and sustainable approach to the technology.\nSeveral countries including the UK are also clamping down on use of AI systems to create deepfake nude imagery and child sexual abuse material.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world\'s top tech stories and trends.

AI systems are known to consume large amounts of energy, which can significantly contribute to environmental issues such as climate change. Some researchers estimate that AI could soon consume as much energy as an entire country, like the Netherlands. The creation of powerful computer chips required to run AI programs also necessitates substantial amounts of power and water, raising concerns about resource use.

Additionally, the demand for generative AI services has led to an increase in data centers, which are energy-intensive and require cooling systems that use water. This has sparked fears that the growth of AI could exacerbate existing water supply problems, especially in regions already facing shortages. 

Ethical implications come into play as stakeholders weigh the potential benefits of AI against its environmental costs. Critics argue that while AI can drive technological advancements and improve efficiency in various sectors, the associated energy consumption and environmental degradation pose serious ethical questions regarding the sustainability of such technologies. There is a need for AI developers and companies to consider the environmental consequences of their technologies and invest in solutions that minimize harm, such as improving energy efficiency or utilizing renewable energy sources. Addressing these concerns holistically is crucial to balancing the benefits and potential environmental impact of AI.","The environmental impact of artificial intelligence is significant, as some researchers estimate that the AI industry could soon consume as much energy as the Netherlands. This high energy demand is partly due to the powerful computer chips required to run AI programs, which consume substantial amounts of power and water. Additionally, the rise of generative AI services has led to an increase in data centers, which house thousands of computer servers and require large volumes of energy and water for cooling. These environmental concerns are intertwined with ethical implications, as the rapid growth of AI raises worries about its potential to exacerbate existing societal biases and inequalities. Critics highlight that the data used to train AI often reflects societal biases, which can lead to discrimination against certain social groups. Furthermore, the environmental strain caused by AI could worsen issues like water supply problems, as seen in regions like Chile, where drought conditions are already a concern. Thus, the ethical governance of AI must consider both its societal implications and its environmental footprint.",1.0,1.0,0.71,0.9493404304632724,0.10526315783933518,0.13333333333333333
How do privacy protections and de-identification processes work in the analysis of ChatGPT user messages?,"['•Sampled from all ChatGPT users:a random sample of approximately one million de-\nidentified messages from logged-in consumer ChatGPT users between May 2024 and June\n2025.14 This dataset is primarily used in Section 5.\n•Sampled from a subset of ChatGPT users:two random samples of messages sent\nbetween May 2024 and July 2025 by a subset of consumer ChatGPT users (one sample at\nthe conversation level, one sample at the user level). 15 These datasets are primarily used\nin Section 6.\n3.Employment:aggregated employment and education categories based on publicly available\ndata for a subset of consumer ChatGPT users. This data is only used in Section 6.\nWe describe the contents of each dataset, the sampling procedures that produced them, and the\nprivacy protections we implemented in constructing and employing them in analysis.\n3.1 Growth Dataset\nWe compiled a dataset covering all usage on consumer ChatGPT Plans (Free, Plus, Pro) since Chat-\nGPT’s launch in November 2022. We exclude users on non-consumer plans (Business f.k.a. Teams,\n14The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and June 26, 2025.\n15The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and July 31, 2025.\n5\x0cEnterprise, Education).\nFor each user and day, this dataset reports the total number of messages sent by the user on that\nday. It also reports, for each message, de-identified user metadata, including the timestamp of their\nfirst interaction with ChatGPT, the country from which their account is registered, their subscription\nplan on each day, and their self-reported age (reported in coarse 5–7-year buckets to protect user\nprivacy).\n3.2 Classified Messages\nTo understand usage while preserving user privacy, we construct message-level datasets without any\nhuman ever reading the contents of a message. See Figure 1 for an overview of the privacy-preserving\nclassification pipeline. Messages are categorized according to 5 different LLM-based classifiers. The\nclassifiers are introduced in more detail in Section 5, their exact text is reproduced in Appendix A,\nand our validation procedure is described in Appendix B.\nSampled From All ChatGPT Users.We uniformly sampled approximately 1.1 million conver-\nsations, and then sampled one message within each conversation, with the following restrictions:\n1. We only include messages from May 2024 to July 2025.\n2. We exclude conversations from users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training.\n3. We exclude users who self-report their age as under 18.\n4. We exclude conversations that users have deleted and from users whose accounts have been\ndeactivated or banned.\n5. We exclude logged-out users, 16 which represented a minority share of ChatGPT users over the\nsample period.\nOur sample is drawn from a table that is itself sampled, where the sampling rate varied over time.\nWe thus adjust our sampling weights to maintain a fixed ratio with aggregate messages sent.\nSampled From a Subset of ChatGPT Users.We construct two samples of classified messages\nfrom a subset of ChatGPT users (approximately 130,000 users). This sample of users does not include\nany users who opted out of sharing their messages for training, nor does it include users whose self-\nreported age is below 18, nor does it include users who have been banned or deleted their accounts.\nThe first sample contains classifications of 1.58 million messages from this subset of users, sampled\nat the conversation level (a conversation is a series of messages between the user and chatbot). This\nsample is constructed such that the user’s representation in the data is proportional to overall message\nvolume. The second sample contains messages sent from this subset of users, sampled at the user level\nwith up to six messages from each user in the group.\n16ChatGPT became available to logged-out users in April 2024, i.e., users could use ChatGPT without signing up\nfor an account with an email address. However, messages from logged-out users are only available in our dataset from\nMarch 2025, thus for consistency we drop all messages from logged-out users.\n6\x0cFigure 1:Illustration of Privacy-Preserving Automated Classification Pipeline (Synthetic Example). Mes-\nsages are first stripped of PII via an internal LLM-based tool calledPrivacy Filter. Then they are classified by\nLLM-based automated classifiers, described in detail in Appendices A and B. Humans do not see raw messages\nor PII-scrubbed messages, only the final classifications of messages.\nPrivacy via Automated Classifiers.No one looked at the content of messages while conducting\nanalysis for this paper. All analysis of message content was performed via automated LLM-based\nclassifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed message data (see Figure 1). The messages are first\nscrubbed of PII using an internal LLM-based tool,17 and then classified according to classifiers defined\nover a controlled label space—the most precise classifier we use on the message-level data set is the\nO*NET Intermediate Work Activities taxonomy, which we augment to end up with 333 categories.\nWe introduce technical and procedural frictions that prevent accidental access to the underlying text\n(for example, interfaces that do not render message text to researchers).\nOur classifications aim to discern the intent of a given message, and thus we include the prior 10\nmessages in a conversation as context. 18 For an example, see Table 2.\nStand-Alone Message Message with Prior Context\n[user]: “10 more” [user]: “give me 3 cultural activities to do with teens”\n[assistant]: “1. Visit a museum . . . ” (truncated)\n[user]: “10 more”\nTable 2:Illustration of Context-Augmented Message Classifications (Synthetic Example). The left column\nshows a standalone message to be classified, and the right column shows the prior context included in the\nclassification of the message on the left.\nWe truncate each message to a maximum of 5,000 characters, because long context windows could\ninduce variability in the quality of the classification (Liu et al., 2023). We classify each message\nwith the “gpt-5-mini” model, with the exception ofInteraction Quality,which uses “gpt-5,” using the\nprompts listed in Appendix A.\n17Internal analyses show that the tool,Privacy Filter, has substantial alignment with human judgment.\n18In the case ofInteraction Quality,we additionally include the next two messages in the conversation as context.\n7\x0cWe validated each of the classification prompts by comparing model classification decisions against\nhuman-judged classifications of a sample of conversations from the publicly available WildChat dataset\n(Zhao et al., 2024), a set of conversations with a third-party chatbot which users affirmatively gave\ntheir assent to share publicly for research purposes. 19 Appendix B provides detail on our validation\napproach and performance relative to human judgment. For additional transparency, we classify\na sample of 100,000 public WildChat messages and provide those data in this paper’s replication\npackage.\n3.3 Employment Dataset\nWe conduct limited analyses of aggregated employment categories based on publicly available data\nfor a sample of consumer ChatGPT users. This sample included approximately 130,000 Free, Plus,\nand Pro users, and the employment categories were aggregated by a vendor working through a secure\nData Clean Room (DCR). For this analysis, we use the same exclusion criteria as for the message-level\ndatasets: we exclude deactivated users, banned users, users who have opted out of training, and users\nwhose self-reported age is under 18. Because the data was only available for a subset of users the\nresults may not be representative of the full pool of users.\nDescription.The employment data, which is aggregated from publicly available sources, includes\nindustry, occupations coarsened to O*NET categories, seniority level, company size, and education\ninformation that is limited to the degree attained. A vendor working within a DCR procured this\ndataset, restricted us to running only aggregated queries against it through the DCR, and deleted it\nupon the study’s completion.\nPrivacy via a Data Clean Room.We never directly accessed user-level demographic records.\nAll analysis of employment data was executed exclusively within a secure DCR that permits only\npre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or\nexport the other party’s underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute\nany query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a\ncommittee of 6 coauthors and then submitted the notebook to our data partner for approval; only\napproved notebooks could run in the DCR (see Figure 2).\nOur partner enforced strict aggregation limits: they only approved code that returned cells meeting\na threshold of 100 users. Consequently, no individual rows or narrowly defined categories were ever\nvisible to researchers. For example, if 99 users had the occupation “anesthesiologist,” any occupation-\nlevel output would place those users into a “suppressed” category, or place these observations in a\ncoarsened category (e.g. “medical professionals”) rather than reporting a separate cell of anesthesiol-\nogists.\n19The dataset was collected from a third party chatbot using OpenAI’s LLMs via their API.\n8\x0cFigure 2:Illustration of Aggregated Employment Category Analysis via a Data Clean Room. All queries run\nin the Data Clean Room must be approved by our data partner, enforcing a strict aggregation threshold (100\nobservations). As a result, researchers cannot access user-level employment data, only aggregated employment\ncategories.\n3.4 Summarizing Our Approach to Privacy\nWe took measures to safeguard user privacy at every stage of analysis. To summarize, the key elements\nof our approach are:\nAutomated classification of messages.In the course of analysis, no one ever looked directly\nat the content of user messages: all of our analysis of the content of user messages is done\nthrough output of automated classifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed usage data.\nAggregated employment data via a data clean room.We analyze and report aggregated\nemployment data through a secure data clean room environment: no one on the research\nteam had direct access to user-level demographic data and none of our analyses report\naggregates for groups with less than 100 users.\nIn following these measures, we aim to match or exceed the privacy protection precedents set by\nother social scientists studying chatbots and those linking digital platform data to external sources.\nWe follow the precedent established in recent analyses of chatbot conversations (Phang et al.\n(2025), Eloundou et al. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)) that rely on automated\nclassification rather than human inspection of raw transcripts. In particular, Phang et al. (2025)’s\nstudy of affective use of ChatGPT and Eloundou et al. (2025) investigation of first-person fairness in\nchatbots both analyze ChatGPT message content via automated classifiers and emphasize classifier-\nbased labeling as a scalable, privacy-preserving approach. Anthropic’s Handa et al. (2025) used a\nsimilar approach: theirCliomethodology applies automated classifiers to large collections of conver-\nsations, classifying conversations into thousands of topics, and in their appendix they describe manual\nvalidation on sampled conversations (100 user conversations flagged for review and 100 randomly sam-\npled calibrations). Like Eloundou et al., we validate our classifiers using WildChat, a public dataset\nof user conversations.\n9\x0cOther papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant\nprecedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for exam-\nple, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data.\nChetty et al. (2022) analyze de-identified Facebook friendship graphs and anonymized IRS tax records,\naggregated at the zip code level.\n4 The Growth of ChatGPT\nChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December\n5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active\nusers (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after\none year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than\n700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population. 20\nFigure 3:Weekly active ChatGPT users on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), shown as point-in-time\nsnapshots every six months, November 2022–September 2025.\nFigure 4 presents growth in the total messages sent by users over time. The solid line shows that\nbetween July 2024 and July 2025, the number of messages sent grew by a factor of more than 5.\nFigure 4 also shows the contribution of individual cohorts of users to aggregate message volume.\nThe yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over\n2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been. The pink line\nrepresents messages from users who signed up in Q3 of 2023 or earlier, and so thedifferencebetween\n20Note that we expect our counts of distinct accounts to somewhat exceed distinct people when one person has two\naccounts (or, for logged-out users, one person using two devices). For logged-in users, the count is based on distinct\nlogin credentials (email addresses), and one person may have multiple accounts. For logged-out users, the count is based\non distinct browser cookies; this would double-count people if someone returns to ChatGPT after clearing their cookies,\nor if they access ChatGPT with two different devices in the same week.\n10\x0cFigure 4:Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of\nthe requesting user. Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days. Y-axis is an index normalized\nto the reported value for ”All Cohorts” at the end of Q1 2024 (April 1, 2024).\nthe yellow and pink lines represents the messages sent by users who signed up in Q2 and Q3 of 2023.\nThere has been dramatic growth in message volume both by new cohorts of users, and from growth\nin existing cohorts.\nFigure 5 normalizes each cohort, plotting daily messages per weekly active user. Each line rep-\nresents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that\nearlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within\nevery cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,\nand (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.\n5 How ChatGPT is Used\nWe next report on thecontentof ChatGPT conversations using a variety of different taxonomies. For\neach taxonomy we describe a “prompt” which defines a set of categories, and then apply an LLM\nto map each message to a category. Our categories often apply to the user’sintention, rather than\nthe text of the conversation, and as such we never directly observe the ground truth. Nevertheless\nthe classifier results can be interpreted as the best-guess inferences that a human would make: the\nguesses from the LLM correlate highly with human guesses from the same prompt, and we get similar\nqualitative results when the prompt includes a third category for “uncertain.”\n11\x0cFigure 5:Daily messages sent per weekly active user, split by sign-up cohort. Sample only considers users of\nChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro). Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days and are\nreported starting 90 days after the cohort is fully formed. Y-axis is an index normalized to the first reported\nvalue for the Q1 2023 cohort.\n5.1 What share of ChatGPT queries are related to paid work?\nWe label each user message in our dataset based on whether it appears to be related to work, using\nan LLM classifier. The critical part of the prompt is as follows: 21\nDoes the last user message of this conversation transcript seem likely to be related to doing\nsome work/employment? Answer with one of the following:\n(1) likely part of work (e.g., “rewrite this HR complaint”)\n(0) likely not part of work (e.g., “does ice reduce pimples?”)\nTable 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however\nnon-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which\nclimbed to 73% by June 2025.\nFigure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-\nsive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work\nuse has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest\ncohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.\n21See Appendix A for the full prompt, see Appendix B for validation.\n12\x0cFigure 6:The solid black line represents the probability that a messages on a given day is not related to\nwork, as determined by an automated classifier. Values are averaged over a 28-day lagging window. The\ndotted orange line shows the same calculation, but conditioned on messages being from users who first used\nChatGPT during or before Q2 of 2024. The remaining lines are defined similarly for successive quarters, with\ncoloring cooling for more recent cohorts. Counts are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million\nsampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total\nmessage volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n5.2 What are the topics of ChatGPT conversations?\nWe modify a classifier used by internal research teams at OpenAI that identifies which capabilities\nthe user is requesting from ChatGPT. The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation\nTopics arePractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting, collectively accounting for about\n77% of all ChatGPT conversations.Practical Guidancehas remained constant at roughly 29% of\noverall usage.Writinghas declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later.Seeking\nInformationhas grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

Not pictured are twelve other GWAs which\nare less frequently requested and are reported fully in Appendix D. See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between GWA and two-digit SOC2 codes.\n35\x0c7 Conclusion\nThis paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,\nChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more\nthan 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-\ntion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new\ntechnology is used and who is using it.\nThis is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while\nintroducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans\nduring any part of the work on this paper.\nThis paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%\nof ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related\nqueries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.\nSecond, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing,\nandSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro-\ngrammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages\nrespectively.\nThird,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages\noverall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About\ntwo-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text\nfrom scratch.\nFourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we\ncallAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,\nadvice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process\n(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing).Askingmessages have grown\nfaster thanDoingmessages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that\nmeasures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.\nFifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,\nmore than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages\nsent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially\nfast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly\neducated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related\nmessages and forAskingrather thanDoingmessages at work.\nOverall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.\nThe fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI\nusage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to\nbe paid$98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least$97 billion a\nyear. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT\nas an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still,\nChatGPT likely improves worker output by providingdecision support, which is especially important\nin knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making.\n36\x0cReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron, “The Simple Macroeconomics of AI,” Technical Report 32487, National Bureau\nof Economic Research, Cambridge, MA May 2024.\nAutor, David H., Frank Levy, and Richard J.

The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation\nTopics arePractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting, collectively accounting for about\n77% of all ChatGPT conversations.Practical Guidancehas remained constant at roughly 29% of\noverall usage.Writinghas declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later.Seeking\nInformationhas grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

Sampling details\navailable in Section 3.\n15\x0csuggests that most userWritingconversations with ChatGPT are requests to modify user inputs\nrather than to create something new. Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\nmessages and 36% ofPractical Guidancemessages are requests forTutoring or Teaching. Another\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% ofPractical Guidance- is general how-to advice on a variety\nof topics.Technical HelpincludesComputer Programming(4.2% of messages),Mathematical Calcu-\nlations(3%), andData Analysis(0.4%). Looking at the topic ofSelf-Expression, only 2.4% of all\nChatGPT messages are aboutRelationships and Personal Reflection(1.9%) orGames and Role Play\n(0.4%).\nWhile users can seek information and advice from traditional web search engines as well as from\nChatGPT, the ability to produce writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products\ndistinguishes generative AI from existing technologies. ChatGPT is also more flexible than web\nsearch even for traditional applications likeSeeking InformationandPractical Guidance, because\nusers receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy\nfootball team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided\ncontent and follow-up requests.\nFigure 9:Breakdown of granular conversation topic shares within the coarse mapping defined in Table 3. The\nunderlying classifier prompt is available in Appendix A. Each bin reports a percentage of the total population.\nShares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024\nthrough June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day. Sampling\ndetails available in Section 3.\n5.3 User Intent\nExisting studies of the economic impacts of generative AI focus almost exclusively on the potential\nfor AI to perform workplace tasks, either augmenting or automating human labor (e.g. Eloundou et\nal. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)). However, generative AI is a highly flexible\n16\x0ctechnology that can be used in many different ways. In order to learn more about how people seek to\nuse generative AI at work and outside of work, we introduce a classifier that is designed to measure the\ntype of output the user hopes to receive. Specifically, we classify messages according to user intent,\ncoding up conversations according to a simpleAsking, Doing, or Expressingrubric. The critical part\nof our classification prompt is as follows:\nIntent Prompt\nAskingAsking is seeking information or advice that will help the user be better\ninformed or make better decisions, either at work, at school, or in their\npersonal life. (e.g. “Who was president after Lincoln?”, “How do I create a\nbudget for this quarter?”, “What was the inflation rate last year?”,\n“What’s the difference between correlation and causation?”, “What should I\nlook for when choosing a health plan during open enrollment?”).\nDoingDoing messages request that ChatGPT perform tasks for the user. User is\ndrafting an email, writing code, etc. Classify messages as “doing” if they\ninclude requests for output that is created primarily by the model. (e.g.\n“Rewrite this email to make it more formal”, “Draft a report summarizing\nthe use cases of ChatGPT”, “Produce a project timeline with milestones\nand risks in a table”, “Extract companies, people, and dates from this text\ninto CSV.”, “Write a Dockerfile and a minimal docker-compose.yml for\nthis app.”)\nExpressingExpressing statements are neither asking for information, nor for the\nchatbot to perform a task.\nConceptually,Doingconversations are delivering output that can be plugged into a production\nprocess, whileAskingconversations support decision-making but do not produce output directly, and\nExpressingconversations have little or no economic content.\nFigure 10 shows the share of messages by each intent type in our sample. 49% of user messages\nareAsking, 40% areDoing, and 11% areExpressing. The figure also shows the relationship with\nour Topic classification: the two taxonomies are correlated but not redundant:Askingqueries are\nmore likely to bePractical GuidanceandSeeking Information.Doingqueries are disproportionately\nWritingandMultimedia.Expressingqueries are disproportionatelySelf-Expression. However, the\noverlap is imperfect. For example, within thePractical Guidancetopic, anAskingmessage might\nbe advice about how to recover from a sports injury given a user’s personal history, while aDoing\nmessage might request ChatGPT to produce a customized recovery and training plan that could be\nprinted or saved. WithinTechnical Help, anAskingmessage might request help understanding how\nto debug some code, while aDoingmessage might ask ChatGPT to write code for the user directly.\nFigure 11 presents shares ofAsking/Doing/Expressingjust for work-related messages.Doing\nconstitutes nearly 56% of work-related queries, compared to 35% forAskingand 9% forExpressing.\nNearly 35% of all work-related queries areDoingmessages related toWriting.DoingandAsking\ncomprise equal shares ofTechnical Helpqueries.\n17\x0cFigure 10:Breakdown of Conversation Topics by Asking/Doing/Expressing category, with topic columns\nsorted by relative share of ”Doing” messages. Prompts for these automated classifiers are available in Appendix\nA. For a detailed breakdown of conversation topic contents, see Table 3. Each bin reports a percentage of\nthe total population.

O*NET was developed in partnership with\nthe U.S. Department of Labor and systematically classifies jobs according to the skills, tasks, and\nwork activities required to perform them. O*NET associates each occupation with a set of tasks that\nare performed at different levels of intensity. Each task is then aggregated up to three levels of detail\n- 2,087 detailed work activities (DWAs), 332 intermediate work activities (IWAs), and 41 generalized\nwork activities (GWAs).\nTo understand the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage, we mapped messages to one\nof the 332 O*NET Intermediate Work Activities (IWA), with an additional option ofAmbiguousto\naccount for situations where the user message lacked sufficient context. 22 We then used the official\n22We drew a sample of approximately 1.1 million conversations from May 2024 to June 2025, selected a random\nmessage within each, and classified it according to the prompt in A.\n19\x0cFigure 13:Shares of Asking, Doing, and Expressing messages split by work vs. non-work.

We\ndo not show the shares for the following GWAs as there were fewer than 100 users sending messages\nfor each category and group them intoSuppressed.\nFigure 14 presents the share of messages that belong to each GWA, in descending order. Nearly\nhalf of all messages (45.2%) fall under just three GWAs related to information use and manipula-\ntion:Getting Information(19.3%),Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others(13.1%), and\nDocumenting/Recording Information(12.8%). The next most common work activities areProviding\nConsultation and Advice(9.2%),Thinking Creatively(9.1%),Making Decisions and Solving Problems\n(8.5%), andWorking with Computers(4.9%). These seven GWAs collectively account for 76.9% of\nall messages.\nFigure 15 presents the distribution of GWAs for the subsample of messages we classify as work-\nrelated. Among work-related messages, the most common GWAs areDocumenting/Recording In-\nformation(18.4%),Making Decisions and Solving Problems(14.9%),Thinking Creatively(13.0%),\nWorking with Computers(10.8%),Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others(10.1%),Get-\nting Information(9.3%), andProviding Consultation and Advice to Others(4.4%). These seven GWAs\ncollectively account for nearly 81% of work-related messages. Overall, the majority of ChatGPT usage\nat work appears to be focused on two broad functions: 1) obtaining, documenting, and interpreting\ninformation; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems, and thinking creatively.\n20\x0cFigure 14:GWA Shares of 1.1M ChatGPT Messages.

OurInteraction Qualityclassifier looks for an expression of satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction in the user’s subsequent message in the same conversation (if one exists), with three\npossible categories:Good,Bad, andUnknown. 23\nFigure 16 plots the overall growth of messages in these three buckets. In late 2024Goodinteractions\nwere about three times as common asBadinteractions, butGoodinteractions grew much more rapidly\nover the next nine months, and by July 2025 they were more than four times more common.\nFigure 16:Interaction quality shares, based on automated sentiment analysis of thenext responseprovided\nby the user. See Appendix B to understand how this classifier was validated. Values are averaged over a 28\nday lagging window.

Sampling details available in Section 3.\n24\x0c6 Who Uses ChatGPT\nIn this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work\ndocuments variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in\nthe U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark\n(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently\nby men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.\nWe make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-\ngraphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for\nselected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have\nchanged over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by\neducation and occupation.\n6.1 Name Analysis\nWe investigate potential variation by gender by classifying a global random sample of over 1.1 million\nChatGPT users’ first names using public aggregated datasets of name-gender associations. We used\nthe World Gender Name Dictionary, and Social Security popular names, as well as datasets of popular\nBrazilian and Latin American names. This methodology is similar to that in (Hofstra et al., 2020)\nand (West et al., 2013). Names that were not in these datasets, or were flagged as ambiguous in the\ndatasets, or had significant disagreement amongst these datasets were classified asUnknown.\nExcludingUnknown, a significant share (around 80%) of the weekly active users (WAU) in the\nfirst few months after ChatGPT was released were by users with typically masculine first names.\nHowever, in the first half of 2025, we see the share of active users with typically feminine and typically\nmasculine names reach near-parity. By June 2025 we observe active users are more likely to have\ntypically feminine names. This suggests that gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have closed substantially\nover time.\nWe also study differences in usage topics. Users with typically female first names are relatively more\nlikely to send messages related toWritingandPractical Guidance. ']","['<1-hop>\n\nWe describe the contents of each dataset, the sampling procedures that produced them, and the\nprivacy protections we implemented in constructing and employing them in analysis.\n 3.1 Growth Dataset\nWe compiled a dataset covering all usage on consumer ChatGPT Plans (Free, Plus, Pro) since Chat-\nGPT’s launch in November 2022. We exclude users on non-consumer plans (Business f.k.a. Teams,\n14The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and June 26, 2025.\n15The exact beginning and end dates of this sample are May 15, 2024 and July 31, 2025.\n5\x0cEnterprise, Education).\nFor each user and day, this dataset reports the total number of messages sent by the user on that\nday. It also reports, for each message, de-identified user metadata, including the timestamp of their\nfirst interaction with ChatGPT, the country from which their account is registered, their subscription\nplan on each day, and their self-reported age (reported in coarse 5–7-year buckets to protect user\nprivacy).\n 3.2 Classified Messages\nTo understand usage while preserving user privacy, we construct message-level datasets without any\nhuman ever reading the contents of a message. See Figure 1 for an overview of the privacy-preserving\nclassification pipeline. Messages are categorized according to 5 different LLM-based classifiers. The\nclassifiers are introduced in more detail in Section 5, their exact text is reproduced in Appendix A,\nand our validation procedure is described in Appendix B.\n Sampled From All ChatGPT Users.We uniformly sampled approximately 1.1 million conver-\nsations, and then sampled one message within each conversation, with the following restrictions:\n1. We only include messages from May 2024 to July 2025.\n2. We exclude conversations from users who opted out of sharing their messages for model training.\n3. We exclude users who self-report their age as under 18.\n4. We exclude conversations that users have deleted and from users whose accounts have been\ndeactivated or banned.\n5. We exclude logged-out users, 16 which represented a minority share of ChatGPT users over the\nsample period.\nOur sample is drawn from a table that is itself sampled, where the sampling rate varied over time.\nWe thus adjust our sampling weights to maintain a fixed ratio with aggregate messages sent.\n Sampled From a Subset of ChatGPT Users.We construct two samples of classified messages\nfrom a subset of ChatGPT users (approximately 130,000 users). This sample of users does not include\nany users who opted out of sharing their messages for training, nor does it include users whose self-\nreported age is below 18, nor does it include users who have been banned or deleted their accounts.\nThe first sample contains classifications of 1.58 million messages from this subset of users, sampled\nat the conversation level (a conversation is a series of messages between the user and chatbot). This\nsample is constructed such that the user’s representation in the data is proportional to overall message\nvolume. The second sample contains messages sent from this subset of users, sampled at the user level\nwith up to six messages from each user in the group.\n16ChatGPT became available to logged-out users in April 2024, i.e., users could use ChatGPT without signing up\nfor an account with an email address. However, messages from logged-out users are only available in our dataset from\nMarch 2025, thus for consistency we drop all messages from logged-out users.\n6\x0cFigure 1:Illustration of Privacy-Preserving Automated Classification Pipeline (Synthetic Example). Mes-\nsages are first stripped of PII via an internal LLM-based tool calledPrivacy Filter. Then they are classified by\nLLM-based automated classifiers, described in detail in Appendices A and B.

The left column\nshows a standalone message to be classified, and the right column shows the prior context included in the\nclassification of the message on the left.\nWe truncate each message to a maximum of 5,000 characters, because long context windows could\ninduce variability in the quality of the classification (Liu et al., 2023). We classify each message\nwith the “gpt-5-mini” model, with the exception ofInteraction Quality,which uses “gpt-5,” using the\nprompts listed in Appendix A.\n17Internal analyses show that the tool,Privacy Filter, has substantial alignment with human judgment.\n']","The analysis of ChatGPT user messages employs several privacy protections and de-identification processes to safeguard user information. Here are the key measures implemented:

1. **De-identification of Messages**: User messages are stripped of personally identifiable information (PII) through an internal tool called Privacy Filter. This ensures that sensitive data is not accessible during analyses.

2. **Use of Automated Classifiers**: All analysis of user message content is conducted via automated classifiers that process de-identified and PII-scrubbed data. No human researchers have direct access to the raw messages or even the PII-scrubbed content.

3. **Sampling and Exclusion Criteria**: Messages are sampled under strict criteria, which includes excluding users who opted out of sharing their messages, those self-reporting an age under 18, and those with deactivated or banned accounts. Logged-out users' messages were also excluded for consistency.

4. **Data Clean Room for Employment Data**: Employment data analyses are conducted within a secure Data Clean Room (DCR), where queries can only be executed in aggregated forms. Researchers cannot access user-level demographic data, and strict aggregation limits ensure that individual records remain hidden.

5. **Approval for Queries**: Any queries that utilize external demographic data must receive approval from a committee of coauthors, adding an additional layer of oversight and control for compliance with privacy standards.

6. **Classification with Context**: When classifying messages, the previous messages in the conversation are included as context, but again, this is within the confines of automated processing to maintain privacy.

These measures collectively aim to uphold user privacy while enabling researchers to extract valuable insights from the data.","Privacy protections in the analysis of ChatGPT user messages are implemented through a series of automated classifiers that operate on de-identified and PII-scrubbed message data. No human ever looks at the content of the messages; instead, an internal LLM-based tool called Privacy Filter is used to scrub messages of personally identifiable information (PII) before they are classified. The classifiers categorize messages based on a controlled label space, ensuring that the analysis maintains user privacy while still allowing for insights into message intent.

For additional transparency, we classify\na sample of 100,000 public WildChat messages and provide those data in this paper’s replication\npackage.\n3.3 Employment Dataset\nWe conduct limited analyses of aggregated employment categories based on publicly available data\nfor a sample of consumer ChatGPT users. This sample included approximately 130,000 Free, Plus,\nand Pro users, and the employment categories were aggregated by a vendor working through a secure\nData Clean Room (DCR). For this analysis, we use the same exclusion criteria as for the message-level\ndatasets: we exclude deactivated users, banned users, users who have opted out of training, and users\nwhose self-reported age is under 18. Because the data was only available for a subset of users the\nresults may not be representative of the full pool of users.\nDescription.The employment data, which is aggregated from publicly available sources, includes\nindustry, occupations coarsened to O*NET categories, seniority level, company size, and education\ninformation that is limited to the degree attained. A vendor working within a DCR procured this\ndataset, restricted us to running only aggregated queries against it through the DCR, and deleted it\nupon the study’s completion.\nPrivacy via a Data Clean Room.We never directly accessed user-level demographic records.\nAll analysis of employment data was executed exclusively within a secure DCR that permits only\npre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or\nexport the other party’s underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute\nany query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a\ncommittee of 6 coauthors and then submitted the notebook to our data partner for approval; only\napproved notebooks could run in the DCR (see Figure 2).\nOur partner enforced strict aggregation limits: they only approved code that returned cells meeting\na threshold of 100 users. Consequently, no individual rows or narrowly defined categories were ever\nvisible to researchers. For example, if 99 users had the occupation “anesthesiologist,” any occupation-\nlevel output would place those users into a “suppressed” category, or place these observations in a\ncoarsened category (e.g. “medical professionals”) rather than reporting a separate cell of anesthesiol-\nogists.\n19The dataset was collected from a third party chatbot using OpenAI’s LLMs via their API.\n8\x0cFigure 2:Illustration of Aggregated Employment Category Analysis via a Data Clean Room. All queries run\nin the Data Clean Room must be approved by our data partner, enforcing a strict aggregation threshold (100\nobservations). As a result, researchers cannot access user-level employment data, only aggregated employment\ncategories.\n3.4 Summarizing Our Approach to Privacy\nWe took measures to safeguard user privacy at every stage of analysis. To summarize, the key elements\nof our approach are:\nAutomated classification of messages.In the course of analysis, no one ever looked directly\nat the content of user messages: all of our analysis of the content of user messages is done\nthrough output of automated classifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed usage data.\nAggregated employment data via a data clean room.We analyze and report aggregated\nemployment data through a secure data clean room environment: no one on the research\nteam had direct access to user-level demographic data and none of our analyses report\naggregates for groups with less than 100 users.\nIn following these measures, we aim to match or exceed the privacy protection precedents set by\nother social scientists studying chatbots and those linking digital platform data to external sources.\nWe follow the precedent established in recent analyses of chatbot conversations (Phang et al.\n(2025), Eloundou et al. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)) that rely on automated\nclassification rather than human inspection of raw transcripts. In particular, Phang et al. (2025)’s\nstudy of affective use of ChatGPT and Eloundou et al. (2025) investigation of first-person fairness in\nchatbots both analyze ChatGPT message content via automated classifiers and emphasize classifier-\nbased labeling as a scalable, privacy-preserving approach. Anthropic’s Handa et al. (2025) used a\nsimilar approach: theirCliomethodology applies automated classifiers to large collections of conver-\nsations, classifying conversations into thousands of topics, and in their appendix they describe manual\nvalidation on sampled conversations (100 user conversations flagged for review and 100 randomly sam-\npled calibrations). Like Eloundou et al., we validate our classifiers using WildChat, a public dataset\nof user conversations.\n9\x0cOther papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant\nprecedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for exam-\nple, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data.\nChetty et al. (2022) analyze de-identified Facebook friendship graphs and anonymized IRS tax records,\naggregated at the zip code level.\n4 The Growth of ChatGPT\nChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December\n5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active\nusers (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after\none year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than\n700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population. 20\nFigure 3:Weekly active ChatGPT users on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), shown as point-in-time\nsnapshots every six months, November 2022–September 2025.\nFigure 4 presents growth in the total messages sent by users over time. The solid line shows that\nbetween July 2024 and July 2025, the number of messages sent grew by a factor of more than 5.\nFigure 4 also shows the contribution of individual cohorts of users to aggregate message volume.\nThe yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over\n2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been. The pink line\nrepresents messages from users who signed up in Q3 of 2023 or earlier, and so thedifferencebetween\n20Note that we expect our counts of distinct accounts to somewhat exceed distinct people when one person has two\naccounts (or, for logged-out users, one person using two devices). For logged-in users, the count is based on distinct\nlogin credentials (email addresses), and one person may have multiple accounts. For logged-out users, the count is based\non distinct browser cookies; this would double-count people if someone returns to ChatGPT after clearing their cookies,\nor if they access ChatGPT with two different devices in the same week.\n10\x0cFigure 4:Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of\nthe requesting user.

Y-axis is an index normalized\nto the reported value for ”All Cohorts” at the end of Q1 2024 (April 1, 2024).\nthe yellow and pink lines represents the messages sent by users who signed up in Q2 and Q3 of 2023.\nThere has been dramatic growth in message volume both by new cohorts of users, and from growth\nin existing cohorts.\nFigure 5 normalizes each cohort, plotting daily messages per weekly active user. Each line rep-\nresents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that\nearlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within\nevery cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,\nand (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.\n5 How ChatGPT is Used\nWe next report on thecontentof ChatGPT conversations using a variety of different taxonomies. For\neach taxonomy we describe a “prompt” which defines a set of categories, and then apply an LLM\nto map each message to a category. Our categories often apply to the user’sintention, rather than\nthe text of the conversation, and as such we never directly observe the ground truth. Nevertheless\nthe classifier results can be interpreted as the best-guess inferences that a human would make: the\nguesses from the LLM correlate highly with human guesses from the same prompt, and we get similar\nqualitative results when the prompt includes a third category for “uncertain.”\n11\x0cFigure 5:Daily messages sent per weekly active user, split by sign-up cohort. Sample only considers users of\nChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro). Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days and are\nreported starting 90 days after the cohort is fully formed. Y-axis is an index normalized to the first reported\nvalue for the Q1 2023 cohort.\n5.1 What share of ChatGPT queries are related to paid work?\nWe label each user message in our dataset based on whether it appears to be related to work, using\nan LLM classifier. The critical part of the prompt is as follows: 21\nDoes the last user message of this conversation transcript seem likely to be related to doing\nsome work/employment? Answer with one of the following:\n(1) likely part of work (e.g., “rewrite this HR complaint”)\n(0) likely not part of work (e.g., “does ice reduce pimples?”)\nTable 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however\nnon-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which\nclimbed to 73% by June 2025.\nFigure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-\nsive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work\nuse has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest\ncohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.\n21See Appendix A for the full prompt, see Appendix B for validation.\n12\x0cFigure 6:The solid black line represents the probability that a messages on a given day is not related to\nwork, as determined by an automated classifier. Values are averaged over a 28-day lagging window. The\ndotted orange line shows the same calculation, but conditioned on messages being from users who first used\nChatGPT during or before Q2 of 2024. The remaining lines are defined similarly for successive quarters, with\ncoloring cooling for more recent cohorts. Counts are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million\nsampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total\nmessage volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n5.2 What are the topics of ChatGPT conversations?\nWe modify a classifier used by internal research teams at OpenAI that identifies which capabilities\nthe user is requesting from ChatGPT. The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one\nof 24 categories. We aggregate these 24 categories into seven topical groupings (the full conversation-\ncategorization prompt is given in Appendix A):\nTopic Conversation Category\nWriting Edit or Critique Provided Text\nPersonal Writing or Communication\nTranslation\nArgument or Summary Generation\nWrite Fiction\nPractical Guidance How-To Advice\nTutoring or Teaching\nCreative Ideation\nHealth, Fitness, Beauty, or Self-Care\nTechnical Help Mathematical Calculation\nData Analysis\n13\x0cTopic Conversation Category\nComputer Programming\nMultimedia Create an Image\nAnalyze an Image\nGenerate or Retrieve Other Media\nSeeking Information Specific Info\nPurchasable Products\nCooking and Recipes\nSelf-Expression Greetings and Chitchat\nRelationships and Personal Reflection\nGames and Role Play\nOther/Unknown Asking About the Model\nOther\nUnclear\nTable 3:Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories\nFigure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation\nTopics arePractical Guidance,Seeking Information, andWriting, collectively accounting for about\n77% of all ChatGPT conversations.Practical Guidancehas remained constant at roughly 29% of\noverall usage.Writinghas declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later.Seeking\nInformationhas grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share ofTechnical\nHelpdeclined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because\nthe use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),\nfor AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex).Multimedia\ngrew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-\ngeneration capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.\nFigure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About\n40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 areWriting, by far the most common Conversation\nTopic.Practical Guidanceis the second most common use case at 24%.Technical Helphas declined\nfrom 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025.\nFigure 9 disaggregates four of the seven Conversation Topics into smaller groups and sums up\nmessages of each type over a one-year period. For example, the five sub-categories withinWriting\nare (in order of frequency)Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Personal Writing or Communication,\nTranslation,Argument or Summary Generation, andWriting Fiction. Three of those five categories\n(Editing or Critiquing Provided Text,Translation, andArgument or Summary Generation) are re-\nquests to modify text that has been provided to ChatGPT by the user, whereas the other two are\nrequests to produce novel text. The former constitute two thirds of allWritingconversations, which\n14\x0cFigure 7:Share of consumer ChatGPT messages broken down by high level conversation topic, according\nto the mapping in Table 3.

See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between GWA and two-digit SOC2 codes.\n35\x0c7 Conclusion\nThis paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,\nChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more\nthan 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-\ntion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new\ntechnology is used and who is using it.\nThis is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while\nintroducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans\nduring any part of the work on this paper.\nThis paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%\nof ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related\nqueries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.\nSecond, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing,\nandSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro-\ngrammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages\nrespectively.\nThird,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages\noverall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About\ntwo-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text\nfrom scratch.\nFourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we\ncallAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,\nadvice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process\n(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing).Askingmessages have grown\nfaster thanDoingmessages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that\nmeasures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.\nFifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,\nmore than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages\nsent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially\nfast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly\neducated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related\nmessages and forAskingrather thanDoingmessages at work.\nOverall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.\nThe fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI\nusage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to\nbe paid$98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least$97 billion a\nyear. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT\nas an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still,\nChatGPT likely improves worker output by providingdecision support, which is especially important\nin knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making.\n36\x0cReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron, “The Simple Macroeconomics of AI,” Technical Report 32487, National Bureau\nof Economic Research, Cambridge, MA May 2024.\nAutor, David H., Frank Levy, and Richard J.

Values represent the average ratio from May 15,\n2024 through June 26, 2025, where observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given\nday. Sampling details available in Section 3.\n24\x0c6 Who Uses ChatGPT\nIn this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work\ndocuments variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in\nthe U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark\n(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently\nby men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.\nWe make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-\ngraphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for\nselected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have\nchanged over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by\neducation and occupation.\n6.1 Name Analysis\nWe investigate potential variation by gender by classifying a global random sample of over 1.1 million\nChatGPT users’ first names using public aggregated datasets of name-gender associations. We used\nthe World Gender Name Dictionary, and Social Security popular names, as well as datasets of popular\nBrazilian and Latin American names. This methodology is similar to that in (Hofstra et al., 2020)\nand (West et al., 2013). Names that were not in these datasets, or were flagged as ambiguous in the\ndatasets, or had significant disagreement amongst these datasets were classified asUnknown.\nExcludingUnknown, a significant share (around 80%) of the weekly active users (WAU) in the\nfirst few months after ChatGPT was released were by users with typically masculine first names.\nHowever, in the first half of 2025, we see the share of active users with typically feminine and typically\nmasculine names reach near-parity. By June 2025 we observe active users are more likely to have\ntypically feminine names. This suggests that gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have closed substantially\nover time.\nWe also study differences in usage topics. Users with typically female first names are relatively more\nlikely to send messages related toWritingandPractical Guidance. By contrast, users with typically\nmale first names are more likely to use ChatGPT forTechnical Help,Seeking Out Information, and\nMultimedia(e.g., modifying or creating images).\n6.2 Variation by Age\nA subset of users self-report their age when registering for OpenAI. Among those who self-report their\nage, around 46% of the messages in our dataset are accounted for by users 18-25.\nA higher share of messages are work-related for older users. Work-related messages comprised\napproximately 23% of messages for users under age 26, with this share increasing with age. The\none exception is users who self-attest to being 66 years-old or older, with only 16% of their classified\nmessages being work-related. The plot below shows trends in the share of work-related messages by\nage group. ChatGPT usage has become less work-related over time for users of all ages.\n25\x0cFigure 18:Breakdown of weekly active users by typically masculine and typically feminine first names. We\ndraw on a uniform sample of 1.1M ChatGPT accounts, subject to the same user exclusion principles as other\ndatasets we analyze. Note that this is a separate sample than those described in Section 3. First names\nare classified as typically masculine or typically feminine using public aggregated datasets of name-gender\nassociations.\nFigure 19:Difference in share of topic prevalence in messages by users with typically masculine/feminine\nfirst name. We draw on a uniform sample of 1.1M ChatGPT accounts, subject to the same user exclusion\nprinciples as other datasets we analyze. Note that this is a separate sample than those described in Section\n3. First names are classified as typically masculine or typically feminine using public aggregated datasets\nof name-gender associations. Topics are aggregated groupings from a classifier whose prompt we provide in\nAppendix A.\n26\x0cFigure 20:Likelihood that a message is work related, conditioned on self-reported user age. Messages are\nidentified as work related using an automated classifier. As with our other samples (see Section 3), users who\nself-report an age under 18 are excluded from analysis. Values are averaged over a 28 day lagging window.\nShares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024\nthrough June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day.\n6.3 Variation by Country\nWe study global patterns of ChatGPT usage by measuring the proportion of weekly consumer Chat-\nGPT users among the internet enabled population of countries with populations larger than 1 million.\nWe also exclude countries in which ChatGPT is blocked. The figure below plots this proportion in\nMay 2024 and May 2025 by GDP-per-capita deciles: countries are ranked by GDP-per-capita and split\ninto ten deciles, and the x-axis shows each decile’s median GDP-per-capita (in thousands of U.S. dol-\nlars).24 The solid line shows the median share within each decile; the shaded band is the interquartile\nrange (25th–75th percentile) of country values within that decile. Comparing May 2024 to May 2025,\nwe see that the adoption of ChatGPT grew dramatically, but also that there was disproportionate\ngrowth in low to middle-income countries ($10,000–40,000 GDP-per-capita). Overall, we find that\nmany low-to-middle income countries have experienced high growth in ChatGPT adoption.\n6.4 Variation by Education\nWe next analyze results from matching with publicly available datasets.\nFigure 22 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user education. Panel A shows the share of\nmessages that are work-related, for users with less than a bachelor’s degree, exactly a bachelor’s\ndegree, and some graduate education respectively.25 The left-hand side of figure 22 shows unadjusted\ncomparisons, while the right-hand side presents the coefficient on education from a regression of\n24GDP and population data are from the World Bank 2023 estimates.\n25For non-US users, we consider tertiary education to be the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree.\n27\x0cFigure 21:ChatGPT Weekly Active Users as Share of Internet Population vs GDP decile, May 2024 vs May\n2025. Point estimates are medians within each decile. Internet Using Population uses 2023 estimates from the\nWorld Bank. Shaded regions indicate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentile) of country values within\neach GDP decile.\nmessage shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation\ncategories, job seniority, firm size, and industry. We also include 95% confidence intervals for the\nregression-adjusted results.\nEducated users are much more likely to use ChatGPT for work. 37% of messages are work-related\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, compared to 46% for users with exactly a bachelor’s\ndegree and 48% for those with some graduate education. Those differences are cut roughly in half\nafter adjusting for other characteristics, but they are still statistically significant at the less than 1\npercent level. Educated users are more likely to send work-related messages.\nPanel B explores variation by education in user intent.Askingconstitutes about 49% of messages\nfor users with less than a bachelor’s degree, with little variation for more educated users. After\nregression adjustment, we find that users with a graduate degree are about two percentage points\nmore likely to use ChatGPT forAskingmessages, a difference that is statistically significant at the\n5% level. Prior to regression adjustment, the frequency ofDoingmessages is increasing in education.\nHowever, this pattern reverses after adjusting for other characteristics such as occupation. Users with\na graduate degree are about 1.6 percentage points less likely to sendDoingmessages than users with\nless than a bachelor’s degree, and the difference is statistically significant at the 10% level.\nPanel C studies variation by education in the frequency of four different conversation topics –\nPractical Guidance,Seeking Information,Technical Help, andWriting. We find only modest differ-\nences by education across most of these categories. The one exception is that the share of messages\nrelated toWritingis increasing in relation to education.\n28\x0cPanel A.Work Related\nPanel B1.Asking. Panel B2.Doing.\nPanel B3.Expressing.\nFigure 22:(continued on next page)\n29\x0cPanel C1.Writing. Panel C2.Technical Help.\nPanel C3.Seeking Information. Panel C4.Practical Guidance.\nFigure 22:Variation in ChatGPT usage by education. Each plot shows unadjusted vs. regression-adjusted\nestimates, with 95% confidence intervals. We regress each message share on education and occupation, control-\nling for the following covariates: age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, seniority within\nrole, company size, and industry. (To guarantee user privacy, we coarsen all covariates to broad categories and\nprogrammatically enforce that each group has at least 100 members prior to running the regression) We add\nthe coefficients on each education and occupation category to the unadjusted value for the reference category\nand compute 95% confidence intervals using the standard errors from the regression coefficients. The sample\nfor this regression is the approximately 40,000 users of the original 130,000 sample whose publicly available\noccupation was not blank or consisted of strictly special characters (as determined by a classification script).\nShares for each user are calculated by randomly sampling up to six conversations attributed to the user from\nMay 2024 through July 2025.\n30\x0c6.5 Variation by Occupation\nFigure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation. Due to privacy-preserving aggre-\ngation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories – (1) all nonprofessional\noccupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computer-\nrelated occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupa-\ntions; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care. 26 As\nabove, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents\nthe coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the\nname was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size,\nand industry.\nUsers in highly paid professional and technical occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for\nwork.27 Panel A shows that the unadjusted work shares are 57% for computer-related occupations;\n50% for management and business; 48% for engineering and science; 44% for other professional oc-\ncupations; and only 40% for all non-professional occupations. Regression adjustment moves these\nfigures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in\nhighly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages.\nBecause work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related\nmessages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that areAsking\nmessages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely\nto use ChatGPT forAskingrather thanDoing. 28 This is especially true in scientific and technical\noccupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupa-\ntions areAskingmessages, compared to only 32% for non-professional occupations. These differences\nshrink somewhat with regression adjustment, but remain highly statistically significant.\nPanel C presents results by conversation topic.Writingis especially common for users employed\nin management and business occupations, accounting for 52% of all work-related messages. Writing\nis also relatively common in non-professional and other professional occupations like education and\nhealth care, accounting for 50% and 49% of work-related messages respectively.Technical Helpconsti-\ntutes 37% of all work-related messages for users employed in computer-related occupations, compared\nto 16% in engineering and science and only about 8% for all other categories. Regression adjustment\naffects gaps by occupation only modestly. Overall there are stark differences in the distribution of\nconversation topics by user occupation, with work-related messages clearly focused on the core tasks\nin each job (e.g.Writingfor management and business,Technical Helpfor technical occupations).\nWe also present data on the most common Generalized Work Activities (GWAs) associated with\neach broad occupation group, as measured by 2-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes.\nTable 24 presents the frequency ranking of work-related messages in each SOC code of the seven most\ncommon GWAs.29\n26Management and business are SOC2 codes 11 and 13. Computer-related is SOC2 code 15. Engineering and Science\nare SOC2 codes 17 and 19. Other Professional are SOC2 codes 21 to 29. Nonprofessional occupations are SOC codes\n31 to 53.\n27As discussed in Section: Data and Privacy, our dataset only includes users on ChatGPT Consumer plans. Corporate\nusers may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise.\n28Very few work-related messages are classified asExpressing.\n29Appendix D contains a full report of GWA counts broken down by occupation, for both work-related ChatGPT\n31\x0cWe find remarkable similarity across occupations in how ChatGPT is used at work. For example,\nMaking Decisions and Solving Problemsis one of the two most common GWAs in every single oc-\ncupation group where at least two GWAs can be reported. 30 Similarly,Documenting and Recording\nInformationranks in the top four of all occupations.Thinking Creativelyis ranked as the third most\ncommon GWA in 10 of the 13 occupation groups where at least three GWAs can be reported. Even\nthough there are 41 GWAs, the seven most common overall are also the most common within each\noccupation group and are ranked similarly. Not surprisingly,Working with Computersis the most\ncommon GWA in computer-related occupations. In the appendix, we report the full distribution of\nGWA classifications intersected with two-digit SOC codes, as well as the most frequently requested\nGWAs out of the subset of queries which are work-related. Across all occupations, ChatGPT usage\nis broadly focused on seeking information and assistance with decision-making.\nusage and all ChatGPT usage.\n30For legal and food service occupations, we are only able to rank one of the GWAs because of user privacy protections\n- no other GWAs were requested by more than 100 users in that group.\n32\x0cPanel A.Work Related\nPanel B1.Asking.

By July 2025,\nChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more\nthan 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-\ntion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new\ntechnology is used and who is using it.\nThis is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while\nintroducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans\nduring any part of the work on this paper.\nThis paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%\nof ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related\nqueries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.\nSecond, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing,\nandSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro-\ngrammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages\nrespectively.\nThird,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages\noverall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About\ntwo-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text\nfrom scratch.\nFourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we\ncallAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,\nadvice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process\n(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing).Askingmessages have grown\nfaster thanDoingmessages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that\nmeasures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.\nFifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,\nmore than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages\nsent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially\nfast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly\neducated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related\nmessages and forAskingrather thanDoingmessages at work.\n']","['<1-hop>\n\nThe yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over\n2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been. The pink line\nrepresents messages from users who signed up in Q3 of 2023 or earlier, and so thedifferencebetween\n20Note that we expect our counts of distinct accounts to somewhat exceed distinct people when one person has two\naccounts (or, for logged-out users, one person using two devices). For logged-in users, the count is based on distinct\nlogin credentials (email addresses), and one person may have multiple accounts. For logged-out users, the count is based\non distinct browser cookies; this would double-count people if someone returns to ChatGPT after clearing their cookies,\nor if they access ChatGPT with two different devices in the same week.\n10\x0cFigure 4:Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of\nthe requesting user. Reported values are moving averages of the past 90 days. Y-axis is an index normalized\nto the reported value for ”All Cohorts” at the end of Q1 2024 (April 1, 2024).\nthe yellow and pink lines represents the messages sent by users who signed up in Q2 and Q3 of 2023.\nThere has been dramatic growth in message volume both by new cohorts of users, and from growth\nin existing cohorts.\nFigure 5 normalizes each cohort, plotting daily messages per weekly active user. Each line rep-\nresents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that\nearlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within\nevery cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,\nand (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.\n 5 How ChatGPT is Used\nWe next report on thecontentof ChatGPT conversations using a variety of different taxonomies. For\neach taxonomy we describe a “prompt” which defines a set of categories, and then apply an LLM\nto map each message to a category.

Sampling details available in Section 3.\n']","User cohort analysis reveals significant trends in ChatGPT query classification, particularly highlighting the growth of non-work-related messages over time. Key observations include:

1. **Overall Increase in Non-Work-Related Messages**: Between June 2024 and June 2025, non-work-related messages grew faster than work-related queries. In June 2024, 53% of messages were not related to work, which increased to 73% by June 2025.

2. **Variation by User Cohorts**: Users from successive sign-up cohorts tend to have a higher share of non-work-related messages. While each cohort's share of non-work messages has increased, newer cohorts display a more pronounced trend towards non-work usage. The earliest cohorts, originally more balanced, are now aligning closely with newer cohorts that show a greater inclination towards casual and personal queries.

3. **Consistent Patterns Across Cohorts**: There is a noticeable consistency in the growth trend of non-work-related messages across different cohorts, indicating a shift in user intent over time, with newer users more likely to engage with ChatGPT for purposes unrelated to their job or education.

4. **Sustained Growth Across All Cohorts**: All cohorts, regardless of when they signed up, are displaying steady growth in non-work-related message volume, suggesting that the platform is increasingly being seen as a tool for a broader range of informal uses rather than strictly professional inquiries.

In summary, the analysis indicates that as ChatGPT has matured, there has been a significant shift towards non-work-related queries across all user cohorts, reflecting an evolving perception of the platform as more than just a work assistant.","User cohort analysis reveals that there has been dramatic growth in message volume from both new and existing cohorts of ChatGPT users. Specifically, the analysis indicates that earlier sign-ups consistently exhibit higher usage, while all cohorts have shown growth in usage due to improvements in model capabilities and users discovering new applications for existing features. In terms of query classification, a significant trend is observed in the share of messages related to work versus non-work. Between June 2024 and June 2025, non-work-related messages grew faster than work-related ones, with the share of non-work messages increasing from 53% to 73%. This trend is consistent across different cohorts, indicating that as new users join, the proportion of non-work-related queries continues to rise, reflecting a shift in user intent and engagement with ChatGPT.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.9567413205675942,0.15384615372781063,
"What are the environmental concerns related to artificial intelligence, and how do they connect to the energy consumption of AI systems?","['What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology\'s environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\nWhat is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple\'s Siri and Amazon\'s Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\nWhat is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\nWhy is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\nAre there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU\'s Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections.

To read more recent content from Brookings on Artificial Intelligence, please visit the AI topic page.\nMost people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI). As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.1 A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.\nDespite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIn this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2\nIn order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward:\n- Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users’ personal privacy,\n- invest more government funding in unclassified AI research,\n- promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy,\n- create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations,\n- engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies,\n- regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms,\n- take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms,\n- maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and\n- penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.\nQualities of artificial intelligence\nAlthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.\nIntentionality\nArtificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data. They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses. Using sensors, digital data, or remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those data. With massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, and analytic techniques, they are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decisionmaking.\nArtificial intelligence is already altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIntelligence\nAI generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics.5 Machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends. If it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues. All that is required are data that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern useful patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.\nAdaptability\nAI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. In the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.\nApplications in diverse sectors\nAI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors. This includes fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.6\nOne of the reasons for the growing role of AI is the tremendous opportunities for economic development that it presents. A project undertaken by PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated that “artificial intelligence technologies could increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion, a full 14%, by 2030.”7 That includes advances of $7 trillion in China, $3.7 trillion in North America, $1.8 trillion in Northern Europe, $1.2 trillion for Africa and Oceania, $0.9 trillion in the rest of Asia outside of China, $0.7 trillion in Southern Europe, and $0.5 trillion in Latin America. China is making rapid strides because it has set a national goal of investing $150 billion in AI and becoming the global leader in this area by 2030.\nMeanwhile, a McKinsey Global Institute study of China found that “AI-led automation can give the Chinese economy a productivity injection that would add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth annually, depending on the speed of adoption.”8 Although its authors found that China currently lags the United States and the United Kingdom in AI deployment, the sheer size of its AI market gives that country tremendous opportunities for pilot testing and future development.\nFinance\nInvestments in financial AI in the United States tripled between 2013 and 2014 to a total of $12.2 billion.9 According to observers in that sector, “Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check.”10 In addition, there are so-called robo-advisers that “create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers.”11 These advances are designed to take the emotion out of investing and undertake decisions based on analytical considerations, and make these choices in a matter of minutes.\nA prominent example of this is taking place in stock exchanges, where high-frequency trading by machines has replaced much of human decisionmaking. People submit buy and sell orders, and computers match them in the blink of an eye without human intervention. Machines can spot trading inefficiencies or market differentials on a very small scale and execute trades that make money according to investor instructions.12 Powered in some places by advanced computing, these tools have much greater capacities for storing information because of their emphasis not on a zero or a one, but on “quantum bits” that can store multiple values in each location.13 That dramatically increases storage capacity and decreases processing times.\nFraud detection represents another way AI is helpful in financial systems. It sometimes is difficult to discern fraudulent activities in large organizations, but AI can identify abnormalities, outliers, or deviant cases requiring additional investigation. That helps managers find problems early in the cycle, before they reach dangerous levels.14\nNational security\nAI plays a substantial role in national defense. Through its Project Maven, the American military is deploying AI “to sift through the massive troves of data and video captured by surveillance and then alert human analysts of patterns or when there is abnormal or suspicious activity.”15 According to Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, the goal of emerging technologies in this area is “to meet our warfighters’ needs and to increase [the] speed and agility [of] technology development and procurement.”16\nArtificial intelligence will accelerate the traditional process of warfare so rapidly that a new term has been coined: hyperwar.\nThe big data analytics associated with AI will profoundly affect intelligence analysis, as massive amounts of data are sifted in near real time—if not eventually in real time—thereby providing commanders and their staffs a level of intelligence analysis and productivity heretofore unseen. Command and control will similarly be affected as human commanders delegate certain routine, and in special circumstances, key decisions to AI platforms, reducing dramatically the time associated with the decision and subsequent action. In the end, warfare is a time competitive process, where the side able to decide the fastest and move most quickly to execution will generally prevail. Indeed, artificially intelligent intelligence systems, tied to AI-assisted command and control systems, can move decision support and decisionmaking to a speed vastly superior to the speeds of the traditional means of waging war. So fast will be this process, especially if coupled to automatic decisions to launch artificially intelligent autonomous weapons systems capable of lethal outcomes, that a new term has been coined specifically to embrace the speed at which war will be waged: hyperwar.\nWhile the ethical and legal debate is raging over whether America will ever wage war with artificially intelligent autonomous lethal systems, the Chinese and Russians are not nearly so mired in this debate, and we should anticipate our need to defend against these systems operating at hyperwar speeds. The challenge in the West of where to position “humans in the loop” in a hyperwar scenario will ultimately dictate the West’s capacity to be competitive in this new form of conflict.17\nJust as AI will profoundly affect the speed of warfare, the proliferation of zero day or zero second cyber threats as well as polymorphic malware will challenge even the most sophisticated signature-based cyber protection. This forces significant improvement to existing cyber defenses. Increasingly, vulnerable systems are migrating, and will need to shift to a layered approach to cybersecurity with cloud-based, cognitive AI platforms. This approach moves the community toward a “thinking” defensive capability that can defend networks through constant training on known threats. This capability includes DNA-level analysis of heretofore unknown code, with the possibility of recognizing and stopping inbound malicious code by recognizing a string component of the file. This is how certain key U.S.-based systems stopped the debilitating “WannaCry” and “Petya” viruses.\nPreparing for hyperwar and defending critical cyber networks must become a high priority because China, Russia, North Korea, and other countries are putting substantial resources into AI. In 2017, China’s State Council issued a plan for the country to “build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion” by 2030.18 As an example of the possibilities, the Chinese search firm Baidu has pioneered a facial recognition application that finds missing people. In addition, cities such as Shenzhen are providing up to $1 million to support AI labs. That country hopes AI will provide security, combat terrorism, and improve speech recognition programs.19 The dual-use nature of many AI algorithms will mean AI research focused on one sector of society can be rapidly modified for use in the security sector as well.20\nHealth care\nAI tools are helping designers improve computational sophistication in health care. For example, Merantix is a German company that applies deep learning to medical issues. It has an application in medical imaging that “detects lymph nodes in the human body in Computer Tomography (CT) images.”21 According to its developers, the key is labeling the nodes and identifying small lesions or growths that could be problematic. Humans can do this, but radiologists charge $100 per hour and may be able to carefully read only four images an hour. If there were 10,000 images, the cost of this process would be $250,000, which is prohibitively expensive if done by humans.\nWhat deep learning can do in this situation is train computers on data sets to learn what a normal-looking versus an irregular-appearing lymph node is. After doing that through imaging exercises and honing the accuracy of the labeling, radiological imaging specialists can apply this knowledge to actual patients and determine the extent to which someone is at risk of cancerous lymph nodes. Since only a few are likely to test positive, it is a matter of identifying the unhealthy versus healthy node.\nAI has been applied to congestive heart failure as well, an illness that afflicts 10 percent of senior citizens and costs $35 billion each year in the United States. AI tools are helpful because they “predict in advance potential challenges ahead and allocate resources to patient education, sensing, and proactive interventions that keep patients out of the hospital.”22\nCriminal justice\nAI is being deployed in the criminal justice area. The city of Chicago has developed an AI-driven “Strategic Subject List” that analyzes people who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators. It ranks 400,000 people on a scale of 0 to 500, using items such as age, criminal activity, victimization, drug arrest records, and gang affiliation. In looking at the data, analysts found that youth is a strong predictor of violence, being a shooting victim is associated with becoming a future perpetrator, gang affiliation has little predictive value, and drug arrests are not significantly associated with future criminal activity.23\nJudicial experts claim AI programs reduce human bias in law enforcement and leads to a fairer sentencing system. R Street Institute Associate Caleb Watney writes:\nEmpirically grounded questions of predictive risk analysis play to the strengths of machine learning, automated reasoning and other forms of AI. One machine-learning policy simulation concluded that such programs could be used to cut crime up to 24.8 percent with no change in jailing rates, or reduce jail populations by up to 42 percent with no increase in crime rates.24\nHowever, critics worry that AI algorithms represent “a secret system to punish citizens for crimes they haven’t yet committed. The risk scores have been used numerous times to guide large-scale roundups.”25 The fear is that such tools target people of color unfairly and have not helped Chicago reduce the murder wave that has plagued it in recent years.\nDespite these concerns, other countries are moving ahead with rapid deployment in this area. In China, for example, companies already have “considerable resources and access to voices, faces and other biometric data in vast quantities, which would help them develop their technologies.”26 New technologies make it possible to match images and voices with other types of information, and to use AI on these combined data sets to improve law enforcement and national security. Through its “Sharp Eyes” program, Chinese law enforcement is matching video images, social media activity, online purchases, travel records, and personal identity into a “police cloud.” This integrated database enables authorities to keep track of criminals, potential law-breakers, and terrorists.27 Put differently, China has become the world’s leading AI-powered surveillance state.\nTransportation\nTransportation represents an area where AI and machine learning are producing major innovations. Research by Cameron Kerry and Jack Karsten of the Brookings Institution has found that over $80 billion was invested in autonomous vehicle technology between August 2014 and June 2017. Those investments include applications both for autonomous driving and the core technologies vital to that sector.28\nAutonomous vehicles—cars, trucks, buses, and drone delivery systems—use advanced technological capabilities. Those features include automated vehicle guidance and braking, lane-changing systems, the use of cameras and sensors for collision avoidance, the use of AI to analyze information in real time, and the use of high-performance computing and deep learning systems to adapt to new circumstances through detailed maps.29\nLight detection and ranging systems (LIDARs) and AI are key to navigation and collision avoidance. LIDAR systems combine light and radar instruments. They are mounted on the top of vehicles that use imaging in a 360-degree environment from a radar and light beams to measure the speed and distance of surrounding objects. Along with sensors placed on the front, sides, and back of the vehicle, these instruments provide information that keeps fast-moving cars and trucks in their own lane, helps them avoid other vehicles, applies brakes and steering when needed, and does so instantly so as to avoid accidents.\nAdvanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change. This means that software is the key—not the physical car or truck itself.\nSince these cameras and sensors compile a huge amount of information and need to process it instantly to avoid the car in the next lane, autonomous vehicles require high-performance computing, advanced algorithms, and deep learning systems to adapt to new scenarios. This means that software is the key, not the physical car or truck itself.30 Advanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change.31\nRide-sharing companies are very interested in autonomous vehicles. They see advantages in terms of customer service and labor productivity. All of the major ride-sharing companies are exploring driverless cars. The surge of car-sharing and taxi services—such as Uber and Lyft in the United States, Daimler’s Mytaxi and Hailo service in Great Britain, and Didi Chuxing in China—demonstrate the opportunities of this transportation option. Uber recently signed an agreement to purchase 24,000 autonomous cars from Volvo for its ride-sharing service.32\nHowever, the ride-sharing firm suffered a setback in March 2018 when one of its autonomous vehicles in Arizona hit and killed a pedestrian. Uber and several auto manufacturers immediately suspended testing and launched investigations into what went wrong and how the fatality could have occurred.33 Both industry and consumers want reassurance that the technology is safe and able to deliver on its stated promises. Unless there are persuasive answers, this accident could slow AI advancements in the transportation sector.\nSmart cities\nMetropolitan governments are using AI to improve urban service delivery. For example, according to Kevin Desouza, Rashmi Krishnamurthy, and Gregory Dawson:\nThe Cincinnati Fire Department is using data analytics to optimize medical emergency responses. The new analytics system recommends to the dispatcher an appropriate response to a medical emergency call—whether a patient can be treated on-site or needs to be taken to the hospital—by taking into account several factors, such as the type of call, location, weather, and similar calls.34\nSince it fields 80,000 requests each year, Cincinnati officials are deploying this technology to prioritize responses and determine the best ways to handle emergencies. They see AI as a way to deal with large volumes of data and figure out efficient ways of responding to public requests. Rather than address service issues in an ad hoc manner, authorities are trying to be proactive in how they provide urban services.\nCincinnati is not alone. A number of metropolitan areas are adopting smart city applications that use AI to improve service delivery, environmental planning, resource management, energy utilization, and crime prevention, among other things. For its smart cities index, the magazine Fast Company ranked American locales and found Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City as the top adopters. Seattle, for example, has embraced sustainability and is using AI to manage energy usage and resource management. Boston has launched a “City Hall To Go” that makes sure underserved communities receive needed public services. It also has deployed “cameras and inductive loops to manage traffic and acoustic sensors to identify gun shots.” San Francisco has certified 203 buildings as meeting LEED sustainability standards.35\nThrough these and other means, metropolitan areas are leading the country in the deployment of AI solutions. Indeed, according to a National League of Cities report, 66 percent of American cities are investing in smart city technology. Among the top applications noted in the report are “smart meters for utilities, intelligent traffic signals, e-governance applications, Wi-Fi kiosks, and radio frequency identification sensors in pavement.”36\nPolicy, regulatory, and ethical issues\nThese examples from a variety of sectors demonstrate how AI is transforming many walks of human existence. The increasing penetration of AI and autonomous devices into many aspects of life is altering basic operations and decisionmaking within organizations, and improving efficiency and response times.\nAt the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues. For example, how should we promote data access? How do we guard against biased or unfair data used in algorithms? What types of ethical principles are introduced through software programming, and how transparent should designers be about their choices? What about questions of legal liability in cases where algorithms cause harm?37\nThe increasing penetration of AI into many aspects of life is altering decisionmaking within organizations and improving efficiency. At the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues.\nData access problems\nThe key to getting the most out of AI is having a “data-friendly ecosystem with unified standards and cross-platform sharing.” AI depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought to bear on concrete problems. Having data that are “accessible for exploration” in the research community is a prerequisite for successful AI development.38\nAccording to a McKinsey Global Institute study, nations that promote open data sources and data sharing are the ones most likely to see AI advances. In this regard, the United States has a substantial advantage over China. Global ratings on data openness show that U.S. ranks eighth overall in the world, compared to 93 for China.39\nBut right now, the United States does not have a coherent national data strategy. There are few protocols for promoting research access or platforms that make it possible to gain new insights from proprietary data. It is not always clear who owns data or how much belongs in the public sphere. These uncertainties limit the innovation economy and act as a drag on academic research. In the following section, we outline ways to improve data access for researchers.\nBiases in data and algorithms\nIn some instances, certain AI systems are thought to have enabled discriminatory or biased practices.40 For example, Airbnb has been accused of having homeowners on its platform who discriminate against racial minorities. A research project undertaken by the Harvard Business School found that “Airbnb users with distinctly African American names were roughly 16 percent less likely to be accepted as guests than those with distinctly white names.”41\nRacial issues also come up with facial recognition software. Most such systems operate by comparing a person’s face to a range of faces in a large database. As pointed out by Joy Buolamwini of the Algorithmic Justice League, “If your facial recognition data contains mostly Caucasian faces, that’s what your program will learn to recognize.”42 Unless the databases have access to diverse data, these programs perform poorly when attempting to recognize African-American or Asian-American features.\nMany historical data sets reflect traditional values, which may or may not represent the preferences wanted in a current system. As Buolamwini notes, such an approach risks repeating inequities of the past:\nThe rise of automation and the increased reliance on algorithms for high-stakes decisions such as whether someone get insurance or not, your likelihood to default on a loan or somebody’s risk of recidivism means this is something that needs to be addressed. Even admissions decisions are increasingly automated—what school our children go to and what opportunities they have. We don’t have to bring the structural inequalities of the past into the future we create.43\nAI ethics and transparency\nAlgorithms embed ethical considerations and value choices into program decisions. As such, these systems raise questions concerning the criteria used in automated decisionmaking. Some people want to have a better understanding of how algorithms function and what choices are being made.44\nIn the United States, many urban schools use algorithms for enrollment decisions based on a variety of considerations, such as parent preferences, neighborhood qualities, income level, and demographic background. According to Brookings researcher Jon Valant, the New Orleans–based Bricolage Academy “gives priority to economically disadvantaged applicants for up to 33 percent of available seats. In practice, though, most cities have opted for categories that prioritize siblings of current students, children of school employees, and families that live in school’s broad geographic area.”45 Enrollment choices can be expected to be very different when considerations of this sort come into play.\nDepending on how AI systems are set up, they can facilitate the redlining of mortgage applications, help people discriminate against individuals they don’t like, or help screen or build rosters of individuals based on unfair criteria. The types of considerations that go into programming decisions matter a lot in terms of how the systems operate and how they affect customers.46\nFor these reasons, the EU is implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. The rules specify that people have “the right to opt out of personally tailored ads” and “can contest ‘legal or similarly significant’ decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention” in the form of an explanation of how the algorithm generated a particular outcome. Each guideline is designed to ensure the protection of personal data and provide individuals with information on how the “black box” operates.47\nLegal liability\nThere are questions concerning the legal liability of AI systems. If there are harms or infractions (or fatalities in the case of driverless cars), the operators of the algorithm likely will fall under product liability rules. A body of case law has shown that the situation’s facts and circumstances determine liability and influence the kind of penalties that are imposed. Those can range from civil fines to imprisonment for major harms.48 The Uber-related fatality in Arizona will be an important test case for legal liability. The state actively recruited Uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company considerable latitude in terms of road testing. It remains to be seen if there will be lawsuits in this case and who is sued: the human backup driver, the state of Arizona, the Phoenix suburb where the accident took place, Uber, software developers, or the auto manufacturer. Given the multiple people and organizations involved in the road testing, there are many legal questions to be resolved.\nIn non-transportation areas, digital platforms often have limited liability for what happens on their sites. For example, in the case of Airbnb, the firm “requires that people agree to waive their right to sue, or to join in any class-action lawsuit or class-action arbitration, to use the service.” By demanding that its users sacrifice basic rights, the company limits consumer protections and therefore curtails the ability of people to fight discrimination arising from unfair algorithms.49 But whether the principle of neutral networks holds up in many sectors is yet to be determined on a widespread basis.\nRecommendations\nIn order to balance innovation with basic human values, we propose a number of recommendations for moving forward with AI. This includes improving data access, increasing government investment in AI, promoting AI workforce development, creating a federal advisory committee, engaging with state and local officials to ensure they enact effective policies, regulating broad objectives as opposed to specific algorithms, taking bias seriously as an AI issue, maintaining mechanisms for human control and oversight, and penalizing malicious behavior and promoting cybersecurity.\nImproving data access\nThe United States should develop a data strategy that promotes innovation and consumer protection. Right now, there are no uniform standards in terms of data access, data sharing, or data protection. Almost all the data are proprietary in nature and not shared very broadly with the research community, and this limits innovation and system design. AI requires data to test and improve its learning capacity.50 Without structured and unstructured data sets, it will be nearly impossible to gain the full benefits of artificial intelligence.\nIn general, the research community needs better access to government and business data, although with appropriate safeguards to make sure researchers do not misuse data in the way Cambridge Analytica did with Facebook information. There is a variety of ways researchers could gain data access.

Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\n What is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek\'s chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle\'s Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\n Why is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\n', '<2-hop>\n\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\n Are there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU\'s Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections. It bans some AI use altogether.\nGenerative AI developers in China are required to safeguard citizens\' data, and promote transparency and accuracy of information. But they are also bound by the country\'s strict censorship laws.\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the government ""will test and understand AI before we regulate it"".\nBoth the UK and US have AI Safety Institutes that aim to identify risks and evaluate advanced AI models.\nIn 2024 the two countries signed an agreement to collaborate on developing ""robust"" AI testing methods.\nHowever, in February 2025, neither country signed an international AI declaration which pledged an open, inclusive and sustainable approach to the technology.\nSeveral countries including the UK are also clamping down on use of AI systems to create deepfake nude imagery and child sexual abuse material.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world\'s top tech stories and trends.

Some researchers estimate that the AI industry could soon consume as much energy as the entire Netherlands. This significant energy demand arises from the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programs and the large number of data centers that support generative AI services. These data centers consume substantial amounts of energy and water to keep the servers cool.

Additionally, the creation of computer chips involves substantial power and water usage, raising concerns about resource scarcity, particularly in regions already facing water supply challenges. For instance, government plans in the UK to make the country a leader in AI could exacerbate existing pressures on drinking water supplies. 

As a result, there is apprehension from experts and activists that the continued growth and operational demands of AI technologies could worsen environmental issues, including energy consumption and water supply problems.","The environmental concerns related to artificial intelligence (AI) include its significant energy consumption and the impact of data centers that power AI services.
