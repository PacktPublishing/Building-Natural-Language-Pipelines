What concerns are associated with Meta AI?,"[""What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology's environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\n What is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\n What is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek's chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle's Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\n""]","The rise of Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology's environmental impact, ethical implications, and data use.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
What controversy arose involving UnitedHealthcare and AI technology?,"['Why is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\n']","The controversy arose when Apple's AI incorrectly reported that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself.

How is AI impacting the financial sector in the United States?,"['Applications in diverse sectors AI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors. This includes fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.6 One of the reasons for the growing role of AI is the tremendous opportunities for economic development that it presents. A project undertaken by PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated that “artificial intelligence technologies could increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion, a full 14%, by 2030.”7 That includes advances of $7 trillion in China, $3.7 trillion in North America, $1.8 trillion in Northern Europe, $1.2 trillion for Africa and Oceania, $0.9 trillion in the rest of Asia outside of China, $0.7 trillion in Southern Europe, and $0.5 trillion in Latin America. China is making rapid strides because it has set a national goal of investing $150 billion in AI and becoming the global leader in this area by 2030. Meanwhile, a McKinsey Global Institute study of China found that “AI-led automation can give the Chinese economy a productivity injection that would add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth annually, depending on the speed of adoption.”8 Although its authors found that China currently lags the United States and the United Kingdom in AI deployment, the sheer size of its AI market gives that country tremendous opportunities for pilot testing and future development. Finance Investments in financial AI in the United States tripled between 2013 and 2014 to a total of $12.2 billion.9 According to observers in that sector, “Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check.”10 In addition, there are so-called robo-advisers that “create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers.”11 These advances are designed to take the emotion out of investing and undertake decisions based on analytical considerations, and make these choices in a matter of minutes. A prominent example of this is taking place in stock exchanges, where high-frequency trading by machines has replaced much of human decisionmaking. People submit buy and sell orders, and computers match them in the blink of an eye without human intervention. Machines can spot trading inefficiencies or market differentials on a very small scale and execute trades that make money according to investor instructions.12 Powered in some places by advanced computing, these tools have much greater capacities for storing information because of their emphasis not on a zero or a one, but on “quantum bits” that can store multiple values in each location.13 That dramatically increases storage capacity and decreases processing times. Fraud detection represents another way AI is helpful in financial systems. It sometimes is difficult to discern fraudulent activities in large organizations, but AI can identify abnormalities, outliers, or deviant cases requiring additional investigation. That helps managers find problems early in the cycle, before they reach dangerous levels.14 National security AI plays a substantial role in national defense. Through its Project Maven, the American military is deploying AI “to sift through the massive troves of data and video captured by surveillance and then alert human analysts of patterns or when there is abnormal or suspicious activity.”15 According to Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, the goal of emerging technologies in this area is “to meet our warfighters’ needs and to increase [the] speed and agility [of] technology development and procurement.”16 Artificial intelligence will accelerate the traditional process of warfare so rapidly that a new term has been coined: hyperwar. The big data analytics associated with AI will profoundly affect intelligence analysis, as massive amounts of data are sifted in near real time—if not eventually in real time—thereby providing commanders and their staffs a level of intelligence analysis and productivity heretofore unseen. Command and control will similarly be affected as human commanders delegate certain routine, and in special circumstances, key decisions to AI platforms, reducing dramatically the time associated with the decision and subsequent action. In the end, warfare is a time competitive process, where the side able to decide the fastest and move most quickly to execution will generally prevail. Indeed, artificially intelligent intelligence systems, tied to AI-assisted command and control systems, can move decision support and decisionmaking to a speed vastly superior to the speeds of the traditional means of waging war. So fast will be this process, especially if coupled to automatic decisions to launch artificially intelligent autonomous weapons systems capable of lethal outcomes, that a new term has been coined specifically to embrace the speed at which war will be waged: hyperwar. While the ethical and legal debate is raging over whether America will ever wage war']","In the United States, investments in financial AI tripled between 2013 and 2014, reaching a total of $12.2 billion. AI technologies are now making decisions about loans by analyzing a variety of finely parsed data about borrowers, rather than relying solely on credit scores and background checks. Additionally, robo-advisers are creating personalized investment portfolios, eliminating the need for traditional stockbrokers and financial advisers. These advancements aim to remove emotional biases from investing, allowing for rapid decision-making based on analytical considerations. High-frequency trading by machines has also replaced much of human decision-making in stock exchanges, enabling computers to match buy and sell orders almost instantaneously.

How does DNA-level analisis contribute to cybersecurity in the context of AI technologies?,"['Adaptability\nAI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. In the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.\n with artificially intelligent autonomous lethal systems, the Chinese and Russians are not nearly so mired in this debate, and we should anticipate our need to defend against these systems operating at hyperwar speeds. The challenge in the West of where to position “humans in the loop” in a hyperwar scenario will ultimately dictate the West’s capacity to be competitive in this new form of conflict.17 Just as AI will profoundly affect the speed of warfare, the proliferation of zero day or zero second cyber threats as well as polymorphic malware will challenge even the most sophisticated signature-based cyber protection. This forces significant improvement to existing cyber defenses. Increasingly, vulnerable systems are migrating, and will need to shift to a layered approach to cybersecurity with cloud-based, cognitive AI platforms. This approach moves the community toward a “thinking” defensive capability that can defend networks through constant training on known threats. This capability includes DNA-level analysis of heretofore unknown code, with the possibility of recognizing and stopping inbound malicious code by recognizing a string component of the file.']","DNA-level analysis contributes to cybersecurity by enabling the recognition and stopping of inbound malicious code through the identification of string components of files.

This capability includes DNA-level analysis of heretofore unknown code, with the possibility of recognizing and stopping inbound malicious code by recognizing a string component of the file. This is how certain key U.S.-based systems stopped the debilitating “WannaCry” and “Petya” viruses.\nPreparing for hyperwar and defending critical cyber networks must become a high priority because China, Russia, North Korea, and other countries are putting substantial resources into AI. In 2017, China’s State Council issued a plan for the country to “build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion” by 2030.18 As an example of the possibilities, the Chinese search firm Baidu has pioneered a facial recognition application that finds missing people. In addition, cities such as Shenzhen are providing up to $1 million to support AI labs. That country hopes AI will provide security, combat terrorism, and improve speech recognition programs.19 The dual-use nature of many AI algorithms will mean AI research focused on one sector of society can be rapidly modified for use in the security sector as well.20\n Health care\nAI tools are helping designers improve computational sophistication in health care. For example, Merantix is a German company that applies deep learning to medical issues. It has an application in medical imaging that “detects lymph nodes in the human body in Computer Tomography (CT) images.”21 According to its developers, the key is labeling the nodes and identifying small lesions or growths that could be problematic. Humans can do this, but radiologists charge $100 per hour and may be able to carefully read only four images an hour. If there were 10,000 images, the cost of this process would be $250,000, which is prohibitively expensive if done by humans.\nWhat deep learning can do in this situation is train computers on data sets to learn what a normal-looking versus an irregular-appearing lymph node is. After doing that through imaging exercises and honing the accuracy of the labeling, radiological imaging specialists can apply this knowledge to actual patients and determine the extent to which someone is at risk of cancerous lymph nodes. Since only a few are likely to test positive, it is a matter of identifying the unhealthy versus healthy node.\nAI has been applied to congestive heart failure as well, an illness that afflicts 10 percent of senior citizens and costs $35 billion each year in the United States. AI tools are helpful because they “predict in advance potential challenges ahead and allocate resources to patient education, sensing, and proactive interventions that keep patients out of the hospital.”22\n']","North Korea, along with China and Russia, is putting substantial resources into AI technologies.

Wut is the role of AI in the criminal justice system in Chikago?,"['Criminal justice\nAI is being deployed in the criminal justice area. The city of Chicago has developed an AI-driven “Strategic Subject List” that analyzes people who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators. It ranks 400,000 people on a scale of 0 to 500, using items such as age, criminal activity, victimization, drug arrest records, and gang affiliation. In looking at the data, analysts found that youth is a strong predictor of violence, being a shooting victim is associated with becoming a future perpetrator, gang affiliation has little predictive value, and drug arrests are not significantly associated with future criminal activity.23\nJudicial experts claim AI programs reduce human bias in law enforcement and leads to a fairer sentencing system. R Street Institute Associate Caleb Watney writes:\nEmpirically grounded questions of predictive risk analysis play to the strengths of machine learning, automated reasoning and other forms of AI. One machine-learning policy simulation concluded that such programs could be used to cut crime up to 24.8 percent with no change in jailing rates, or reduce jail populations by up to 42 percent with no increase in crime rates.24\nHowever, critics worry that AI algorithms represent “a secret system to punish citizens for crimes they haven’t yet committed. The risk scores have been used numerous times to guide large-scale roundups.”25 The fear is that such tools target people of color unfairly and have not helped Chicago reduce the murder wave that has plagued it in recent years.\nDespite these concerns, other countries are moving ahead with rapid deployment in this area. In China, for example, companies already have “considerable resources and access to voices, faces and other biometric data in vast quantities, which would help them develop their technologies.”26 New technologies make it possible to match images and voices with other types of information, and to use AI on these combined data sets to improve law enforcement and national security. Through its “Sharp Eyes” program, Chinese law enforcement is matching video images, social media activity, online purchases, travel records, and personal identity into a “police cloud.” This integrated database enables authorities to keep track of criminals, potential law-breakers, and terrorists.27 Put differently, China has become the world’s leading AI-powered surveillance state.\n']","AI is being deployed in the criminal justice area in Chicago through the development of an AI-driven 'Strategic Subject List' that analyzes individuals who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators.

What significant investments were made in autonomous vehicle technology by June 2017?,"['Transportation\nTransportation represents an area where AI and machine learning are producing major innovations. Research by Cameron Kerry and Jack Karsten of the Brookings Institution has found that over $80 billion was invested in autonomous vehicle technology between August 2014 and June 2017. Those investments include applications both for autonomous driving and the core technologies vital to that sector.28\nAutonomous vehicles—cars, trucks, buses, and drone delivery systems—use advanced technological capabilities. Those features include automated vehicle guidance and braking, lane-changing systems, the use of cameras and sensors for collision avoidance, the use of AI to analyze information in real time, and the use of high-performance computing and deep learning systems to adapt to new circumstances through detailed maps.29\nLight detection and ranging systems (LIDARs) and AI are key to navigation and collision avoidance. LIDAR systems combine light and radar instruments. They are mounted on the top of vehicles that use imaging in a 360-degree environment from a radar and light beams to measure the speed and distance of surrounding objects. Along with sensors placed on the front, sides, and back of the vehicle, these instruments provide information that keeps fast-moving cars and trucks in their own lane, helps them avoid other vehicles, applies brakes and steering when needed, and does so instantly so as to avoid accidents.\nAdvanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change. This means that software is the key—not the physical car or truck itself.\nSince these cameras and sensors compile a huge amount of information and need to process it instantly to avoid the car in the next lane, autonomous vehicles require high-performance computing, advanced algorithms, and deep learning systems to adapt to new scenarios. This means that software is the key, not the physical car or truck itself.30 Advanced software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change.31\nRide-sharing companies are very interested in autonomous vehicles. They see advantages in terms of customer service and labor productivity. All of the major ride-sharing companies are exploring driverless cars. The surge of car-sharing and taxi services—such as Uber and Lyft in the United States, Daimler’s Mytaxi and Hailo service in Great Britain, and Didi Chuxing in China—demonstrate the opportunities of this transportation option. Uber recently signed an agreement to purchase 24,000 autonomous cars from Volvo for its ride-sharing service.32\nHowever, the ride-sharing firm suffered a setback in March 2018 when one of its autonomous vehicles in Arizona hit and killed a pedestrian. Uber and several auto manufacturers immediately suspended testing and launched investigations into what went wrong and how the fatality could have occurred.33 Both industry and consumers want reassurance that the technology is safe and able to deliver on its stated promises. Unless there are persuasive answers, this accident could slow AI advancements in the transportation sector.\n']","By June 2017, over $80 billion was invested in autonomous vehicle technology, which includes applications for both autonomous driving and the core technologies vital to that sector.",single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

Airbnb do bad things with data?,"['Data access problems\nThe key to getting the most out of AI is having a “data-friendly ecosystem with unified standards and cross-platform sharing.” AI depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought to bear on concrete problems. Having data that are “accessible for exploration” in the research community is a prerequisite for successful AI development.38\nAccording to a McKinsey Global Institute study, nations that promote open data sources and data sharing are the ones most likely to see AI advances. In this regard, the United States has a substantial advantage over China. Global ratings on data openness show that U.S. ranks eighth overall in the world, compared to 93 for China.39\nBut right now, the United States does not have a coherent national data strategy. There are few protocols for promoting research access or platforms that make it possible to gain new insights from proprietary data. It is not always clear who owns data or how much belongs in the public sphere. These uncertainties limit the innovation economy and act as a drag on academic research. In the following section, we outline ways to improve data access for researchers.\n Biases in data and algorithms\nIn some instances, certain AI systems are thought to have enabled discriminatory or biased practices.40 For example, Airbnb has been accused of having homeowners on its platform who discriminate against racial minorities. A research project undertaken by the Harvard Business School found that “Airbnb users with distinctly African American names were roughly 16 percent less likely to be accepted as guests than those with distinctly white names.”41\nRacial issues also come up with facial recognition software. Most such systems operate by comparing a person’s face to a range of faces in a large database. As pointed out by Joy Buolamwini of the Algorithmic Justice League, “If your facial recognition data contains mostly Caucasian faces, that’s what your program will learn to recognize.”42 Unless the databases have access to diverse data, these programs perform poorly when attempting to recognize African-American or Asian-American features.\nMany historical data sets reflect traditional values, which may or may not represent the preferences wanted in a current system. As Buolamwini notes, such an approach risks repeating inequities of the past:\nThe rise of automation and the increased reliance on algorithms for high-stakes decisions such as whether someone get insurance or not, your likelihood to default on a loan or somebody’s risk of recidivism means this is something that needs to be addressed. Even admissions decisions are increasingly automated—what school our children go to and what opportunities they have. We don’t have to bring the structural inequalities of the past into the future we create.43\n']","Airbnb has been accused of enabling discriminatory practices, particularly against racial minorities.

Wht is the GDPR and how does it relate to AI?,"['AI ethics and transparency\nAlgorithms embed ethical considerations and value choices into program decisions. As such, these systems raise questions concerning the criteria used in automated decisionmaking. Some people want to have a better understanding of how algorithms function and what choices are being made.44\nIn the United States, many urban schools use algorithms for enrollment decisions based on a variety of considerations, such as parent preferences, neighborhood qualities, income level, and demographic background. According to Brookings researcher Jon Valant, the New Orleans–based Bricolage Academy “gives priority to economically disadvantaged applicants for up to 33 percent of available seats. In practice, though, most cities have opted for categories that prioritize siblings of current students, children of school employees, and families that live in school’s broad geographic area.”45 Enrollment choices can be expected to be very different when considerations of this sort come into play.\nDepending on how AI systems are set up, they can facilitate the redlining of mortgage applications, help people discriminate against individuals they don’t like, or help screen or build rosters of individuals based on unfair criteria. The types of considerations that go into programming decisions matter a lot in terms of how the systems operate and how they affect customers.46\nFor these reasons, the EU is implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. The rules specify that people have “the right to opt out of personally tailored ads” and “can contest ‘legal or similarly significant’ decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention” in the form of an explanation of how the algorithm generated a particular outcome. Each guideline is designed to ensure the protection of personal data and provide individuals with information on how the “black box” operates.47\nLegal liability\nThere are questions concerning the legal liability of AI systems. If there are harms or infractions (or fatalities in the case of driverless cars), the operators of the algorithm likely will fall under product liability rules. A body of case law has shown that the situation’s facts and circumstances determine liability and influence the kind of penalties that are imposed. Those can range from civil fines to imprisonment for major harms.48 The Uber-related fatality in Arizona will be an important test case for legal liability. The state actively recruited Uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company considerable latitude in terms of road testing. It remains to be seen if there will be lawsuits in this case and who is sued: the human backup driver, the state of Arizona, the Phoenix suburb where the accident took place, Uber, software developers, or the auto manufacturer. Given the multiple people and organizations involved in the road testing, there are many legal questions to be resolved.\n']","The GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation, is a set of rules implemented by the EU in May 2018 that specifies individuals' rights regarding their personal data.

For example, in the case of Airbnb, the firm “requires that people agree to waive their right to sue, or to join in any class-action lawsuit or class-action arbitration, to use the service.” By demanding that its users sacrifice basic rights, the company limits consumer protections and therefore curtails the ability of people to fight discrimination arising from unfair algorithms.49 But whether the principle of neutral networks holds up in many sectors is yet to be determined on a widespread basis.\n Recommendations\nIn order to balance innovation with basic human values, we propose a number of recommendations for moving forward with AI. This includes improving data access, increasing government investment in AI, promoting AI workforce development, creating a federal advisory committee, engaging with state and local officials to ensure they enact effective policies, regulating broad objectives as opposed to specific algorithms, taking bias seriously as an AI issue, maintaining mechanisms for human control and oversight, and penalizing malicious behavior and promoting cybersecurity.\n']",Airbnb limits consumer protections by requiring users to agree to waive their right to sue or join in any class-action lawsuit or class-action arbitration in order to use the service.,single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.1 A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.\nDespite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIn this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2\nIn order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward:\n- Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users’ personal privacy,\n- invest more government funding in unclassified AI research,\n- promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy,\n- create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations,\n- engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies,\n- regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms,\n- take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms,\n- maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and\n- penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.\n Qualities of artificial intelligence\nAlthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.\n']","To maximize the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) while ensuring ethical standards, nine key steps are recommended: 1) Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users’ personal privacy, 2) Invest more government funding in unclassified AI research, 3) Promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development to equip employees with necessary skills, 4) Create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations, 5) Engage with state and local officials to enact effective policies, 6) Regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms, 7) Take bias complaints seriously to prevent AI from replicating historic injustices, 8) Maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and 9) Penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

For more precise details, refer to the papers\nand system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A\nchatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to\nmaximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.\nIn a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT\nreturns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features\nhave been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external\ndatabases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the\nmost typical interaction.\nSince its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5. 12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and\nto the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).\nAn LLM can be thought of as a function from a string of words to a probability distribution over\nthe set of all possible words (more precisely, “tokens,” which very roughly correspond to words13). The\nfunctions are implemented with deep neural nets, typically with a transformer architecture (Vaswani\net al., 2017), parameterized with billions of model “weights”. We will refer to all of ChatGPT’s models\nas language models, though most can additionally process tokens representing images, audio, or other\nmedia.\nThe weights in an LLM-based chatbot are often trained in two stages, commonly called “pre-\ntraining” and “post-training”. In the first stage (“pre-training”), the LLMs are trained to predict the\nnext word in a string, given the preceding words, over an enormous corpus of text. At that point the\nmodels are purely predictors of the likelihood of the next word given a prior context, and as such they\nhave a relatively narrow application. In the second stage (“post-training”), the models are trained to\nproduce words that comprise “good” responses to some prompt. This stage often consists of a variety\nof different strategies: fine-tuning on a dataset of queries and ideal responses, reinforcement learning\nagainst another model that is trained to grade the quality of a response (Ouyang et al., 2022), or\nreinforcement learning against a function that knows the true response to queries (OpenAI (2024b),\n12For a timeline of model launches, see Appendix C.\n13Tokenization is a way of cutting a string of text into discrete chunks, chosen to be statistically efficient. In many\ntokenization schemes, one token corresponds to roughly three-quarters of an English word.\n4\x0cLambert et al. (2024)). This second stage also typically includes a number of “safety” constraints to\navoid certain classes of response, especially those which are deemed harmful or dangerous (OpenAI,\n2025a).\nThis two-stage process has a common statistical interpretation: the first stage teaches the model a\nlatent representation of the world; the second stage fits a function using that representation (Bengio\net al., 2014). Pre-training the model to predict the next word effectively teaches the model a low-\ndimensional representation of text, representing only the key semantic features, and therefore rendering\nthe prompt-response problem tractable with a reasonable set of training examples.\nTwo common ways of evaluating chatbots are with benchmarks (batteries of questions with known\nanswers, e.g. Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (Hendrycks et al., 2021)) and\ncomparisons of human preferences over two alternative responses to the same message (e.g. Chatbot\nArena (Chiang et al., 2024)).\n3 ']","The classification process using the 'gpt-5-mini' model enhances the understanding of user intent in messages by analyzing the context of prior messages in a conversation. This context-augmented classification allows for a more precise discernment of intent, as demonstrated in the example where a standalone message is classified with the help of prior context. ChatGPT, as a chatbot, generates responses based on the underlying LLM, which has been trained to maximize the quality of responses. By utilizing the classifications from the 'gpt-5-mini' model, ChatGPT can produce more relevant and contextually appropriate responses, thereby improving the overall interaction quality.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

"What are the implications of the European Union's restrictive stance on AI regulations for technology companies, particularly in relation to data collection and the development of autonomous vehicles?","['<1-hop>\n\nEngage with state and local officials\nStates and localities also are taking action on AI. For example, the New York City Council unanimously passed a bill that directed the mayor to form a taskforce that would “monitor the fairness and validity of algorithms used by municipal agencies.”60 The city employs algorithms to “determine if a lower bail will be assigned to an indigent defendant, where firehouses are established, student placement for public schools, assessing teacher performance, identifying Medicaid fraud and determine where crime will happen next.”61\nAccording to the legislation’s developers, city officials want to know how these algorithms work and make sure there is sufficient AI transparency and accountability. In addition, there is concern regarding the fairness and biases of AI algorithms, so the taskforce has been directed to analyze these issues and make recommendations regarding future usage. It is scheduled to report back to the mayor on a range of AI policy, legal, and regulatory issues by late 2019.\nSome observers already are worrying that the taskforce won’t go far enough in holding algorithms accountable. For example, Julia Powles of Cornell Tech and New York University argues that the bill originally required companies to make the AI source code available to the public for inspection, and that there be simulations of its decisionmaking using actual data. After criticism of those provisions, however, former Councilman James Vacca dropped the requirements in favor of a task force studying these issues. He and other city officials were concerned that publication of proprietary information on algorithms would slow innovation and make it difficult to find AI vendors who would work with the city.62 It remains to be seen how this local task force will balance issues of innovation, privacy, and transparency.\n Regulate broad objectives more than specific algorithms\nThe European Union has taken a restrictive stance on these issues of data collection and analysis.63 It has rules limiting the ability of companies from collecting data on road conditions and mapping street views. Because many of these countries worry that people’s personal information in unencrypted Wi-Fi networks are swept up in overall data collection, the EU has fined technology firms, demanded copies of data, and placed limits on the material collected.64 This has made it more difficult for technology companies operating there to develop the high-definition maps required for autonomous vehicles.\nThe GDPR being implemented in Europe place severe restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. According to published guidelines, “Regulations prohibit any automated decision that ‘significantly affects’ EU citizens. This includes techniques that evaluates a person’s ‘performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements.’”65 In addition, these new rules give citizens the right to review how digital services made specific algorithmic choices affecting people.\nBy taking a restrictive stance on issues of data collection and analysis, the European Union is putting its manufacturers and software designers at a significant disadvantage to the rest of the world.\nIf interpreted stringently, these rules will make it difficult for European software designers (and American designers who work with European counterparts) to incorporate artificial intelligence and high-definition mapping in autonomous vehicles. Central to navigation in these cars and trucks is tracking location and movements. Without high-definition maps containing geo-coded data and the deep learning that makes use of this information, fully autonomous driving will stagnate in Europe. Through this and other data protection actions, the European Union is putting its manufacturers and software designers at a significant disadvantage to the rest of the world.\nIt makes more sense to think about the broad objectives desired in AI and enact policies that advance them, as opposed to governments trying to crack open the “black boxes” and see exactly how specific algorithms operate. Regulating individual algorithms will limit innovation and make it difficult for companies to make use of artificial intelligence.\n', '<2-hop>\n\nThis article was published in 2018. To read more recent content from Brookings on Artificial Intelligence, please visit the AI topic page.\nMost people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI). As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.1 A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.\nDespite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIn this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2\nIn order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward:\n- Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users’ personal privacy,\n- invest more government funding in unclassified AI research,\n- promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy,\n- create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations,\n- engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies,\n- regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms,\n- take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms,\n- maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and\n- penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.\n Qualities of artificial intelligence\nAlthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.\n']","The European Union's restrictive stance on AI regulations has significant implications for technology companies, particularly regarding data collection and the development of autonomous vehicles. The EU has implemented strict rules that limit companies' ability to collect data on road conditions and mapping street views, primarily due to concerns about personal information being swept up in data collection efforts. This has resulted in fines for technology firms and demands for copies of data, making it challenging for these companies to develop the high-definition maps necessary for autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes severe restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, prohibiting any automated decisions that significantly affect EU citizens. This includes evaluations of personal performance, economic situations, and behaviors. If interpreted stringently, these regulations could hinder European software designers and their American counterparts from effectively incorporating AI and high-definition mapping into autonomous vehicles, ultimately putting them at a disadvantage compared to the rest of the world.

What are the implications of the Uber-related fatality in Arizona for legal liability and how do ethical considerations in AI algorithms relate to this case?,"['<1-hop>\n\nA body of case law has shown that the situation’s facts and circumstances determine liability and influence the kind of penalties that are imposed. Those can range from civil fines to imprisonment for major harms.48 The Uber-related fatality in Arizona will be an important test case for legal liability. The state actively recruited Uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company considerable latitude in terms of road testing. It remains to be seen if there will be lawsuits in this case and who is sued: the human backup driver, the state of Arizona, the Phoenix suburb where the accident took place, Uber, software developers, or the auto manufacturer. Given the multiple people and organizations involved in the road testing, there are many legal questions to be resolved.\nIn non-transportation areas, digital platforms often have limited liability for what happens on their sites. For example, in the case of Airbnb, the firm “requires that people agree to waive their right to sue, or to join in any class-action lawsuit or class-action arbitration, to use the service.” By demanding that its users sacrifice basic rights, the company limits consumer protections and therefore curtails the ability of people to fight discrimination arising from unfair algorithms.49 But whether the principle of neutral networks holds up in many sectors is yet to be determined on a widespread basis.\n Recommendations\nIn order to balance innovation with basic human values, we propose a number of recommendations for moving forward with AI. This includes improving data access, increasing government investment in AI, promoting AI workforce development, creating a federal advisory committee, engaging with state and local officials to ensure they enact effective policies, regulating broad objectives as opposed to specific algorithms, taking bias seriously as an AI issue, maintaining mechanisms for human control and oversight, and penalizing malicious behavior and promoting cybersecurity.\n', '<2-hop>\n\nAI ethics and transparency\nAlgorithms embed ethical considerations and value choices into program decisions.

Some people want to have a better understanding of how algorithms function and what choices are being made.44\nIn the United States, many urban schools use algorithms for enrollment decisions based on a variety of considerations, such as parent preferences, neighborhood qualities, income level, and demographic background. According to Brookings researcher Jon Valant, the New Orleans–based Bricolage Academy “gives priority to economically disadvantaged applicants for up to 33 percent of available seats. In practice, though, most cities have opted for categories that prioritize siblings of current students, children of school employees, and families that live in school’s broad geographic area.”45 Enrollment choices can be expected to be very different when considerations of this sort come into play.\nDepending on how AI systems are set up, they can facilitate the redlining of mortgage applications, help people discriminate against individuals they don’t like, or help screen or build rosters of individuals based on unfair criteria. The types of considerations that go into programming decisions matter a lot in terms of how the systems operate and how they affect customers.46\nFor these reasons, the EU is implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. The rules specify that people have “the right to opt out of personally tailored ads” and “can contest ‘legal or similarly significant’ decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention” in the form of an explanation of how the algorithm generated a particular outcome. Each guideline is designed to ensure the protection of personal data and provide individuals with information on how the “black box” operates.47\nLegal liability\nThere are questions concerning the legal liability of AI systems. If there are harms or infractions (or fatalities in the case of driverless cars), the operators of the algorithm likely will fall under product liability rules. A body of case law has shown that the situation’s facts and circumstances determine liability and influence the kind of penalties that are imposed. Those can range from civil fines to imprisonment for major harms.48 The Uber-related fatality in Arizona will be an important test case for legal liability. The state actively recruited Uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company considerable latitude in terms of road testing. It remains to be seen if there will be lawsuits in this case and who is sued: the human backup driver, the state of Arizona, the Phoenix suburb where the accident took place, Uber, software developers, or the auto manufacturer. Given the multiple people and organizations involved in the road testing, there are many legal questions to be resolved.\n']","The Uber-related fatality in Arizona serves as a significant test case for legal liability concerning autonomous vehicles. The state of Arizona actively recruited Uber to test its self-driving cars, granting the company considerable latitude for road testing. This situation raises numerous legal questions about who may be held liable, including the human backup driver, the state, the local Phoenix suburb, Uber, software developers, or the auto manufacturer. The outcome of this case could influence future legal standards for liability in similar incidents. Additionally, ethical considerations in AI algorithms are crucial, as they embed value choices into automated decision-making processes. The algorithms used in AI systems can lead to various outcomes based on the criteria set for decision-making, which can affect individuals' lives significantly.

Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\n What is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek's chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle's Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\n"", '<2-hop>\n\nWhy is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI\'s potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the ""godfathers"" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow ""AI godfather"", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech\'s potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to ""hallucinate"" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple\'s AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to ""cheat"" on assignments, or employees ""smuggling"" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Björn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement in October 2024 calling AI a ""major, unjust threat"" to their livelihoods.\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a ""world leader"" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\n']","Apple's AI technology, such as Siri, is part of the broader use of artificial intelligence that has raised concerns regarding its environmental impact and ethical implications. While Siri personalizes user experiences and enhances functionality, the rapid growth of AI technologies, including those developed by Apple, has led to worries about their energy consumption and the resources required to support them. The creation of powerful computer chips for AI systems demands significant power and water, contributing to environmental strain.

As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.1 A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.\nDespite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance.\nIn this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2\nIn order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward:\n- Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users’ personal privacy,\n- invest more government funding in unclassified AI research,\n- promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy,\n- create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations,\n- engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies,\n- regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms,\n- take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms,\n- maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and\n- penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.\n Qualities of artificial intelligence\nAlthough there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.\n']","Some creative writing prompts that can be used for data analysis in AI policy development include: 'Create a short story about a time-traveling astronaut,' 'Make a rap in the style of Drake about the ocean,' and 'Compose a sonnet about time.'

Its experts suggest that these models be programmed with consideration for widely accepted human norms and rules for behavior. AI algorithms need to take into effect the importance of these norms, how norm conflict can be resolved, and ways these systems can be transparent about norm resolution. Software designs should be programmed for “nondeception” and “honesty,” according to ethics experts. When failures occur, there must be mitigation mechanisms to deal with the consequences. In particular, AI must be sensitive to problems such as bias, discrimination, and fairness.68\nA group of machine learning experts claim it is possible to automate ethical decisionmaking. Using the trolley problem as a moral dilemma, they ask the following question: If an autonomous car goes out of control, should it be programmed to kill its own passengers or the pedestrians who are crossing the street? They devised a “voting-based system” that asked 1.3 million people to assess alternative scenarios, summarized the overall choices, and applied the overall perspective of these individuals to a range of vehicular possibilities. That allowed them to automate ethical decisionmaking in AI algorithms, taking public preferences into account.69 This procedure, of course, does not reduce the tragedy involved in any kind of fatality, such as seen in the Uber case, but it provides a mechanism to help AI developers incorporate ethical considerations in their planning.\n Penalize malicious behavior and promote cybersecurity\nAs with any emerging technology, it is important to discourage malicious treatment designed to trick software or use it for undesirable ends.70 This is especially important given the dual-use aspects of AI, where the same tool can be used for beneficial or malicious purposes. The malevolent use of AI exposes individuals and organizations to unnecessary risks and undermines the virtues of the emerging technology. This includes behaviors such as hacking, manipulating algorithms, compromising privacy and confidentiality, or stealing identities. Efforts to hijack AI in order to solicit confidential information should be seriously penalized as a way to deter such actions.71\nIn a rapidly changing world with many entities having advanced computing capabilities, there needs to be serious attention devoted to cybersecurity. Countries have to be careful to safeguard their own systems and keep other nations from damaging their security.72 According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a major American bank receives around 11 million calls a week at its service center. In order to protect its telephony from denial of service attacks, it uses a “machine learning-based policy engine [that] blocks more than 120,000 calls per month based on voice firewall policies including harassing callers, robocalls and potential fraudulent calls.”73 This represents a way in which machine learning can help defend technology systems from malevolent attacks.\n', '<3-hop>\n\nTake biases seriously\nBias and discrimination are serious issues for AI. There already have been a number of cases of unfair treatment linked to historic data, and steps need to be undertaken to make sure that does not become prevalent in artificial intelligence. Existing statutes governing discrimination in the physical economy need to be extended to digital platforms. That will help protect consumers and build confidence in these systems as a whole.\nFor these advances to be widely adopted, more transparency is needed in how AI systems operate. Andrew Burt of Immuta argues, “The key problem confronting predictive analytics is really transparency. We’re in a world where data science operations are taking on increasingly important tasks, and the only thing holding them back is going to be how well the data scientists who train the models can explain what it is their models are doing.”66\n Maintaining mechanisms for human oversight and control\nSome individuals have argued that there needs to be avenues for humans to exercise oversight and control of AI systems. For example, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence CEO Oren Etzioni argues there should be rules for regulating these systems. First, he says, AI must be governed by all the laws that already have been developed for human behavior, including regulations concerning “cyberbullying, stock manipulation or terrorist threats,” as well as “entrap[ping] people into committing crimes.” Second, he believes that these systems should disclose they are automated systems and not human beings. Third, he states, “An A.I. system cannot retain or disclose confidential information without explicit approval from the source of that information.”67 His rationale is that these tools store so much data that people have to be cognizant of the privacy risks posed by AI.\nIn the same vein, the IEEE Global Initiative has ethical guidelines for AI and autonomous systems. Its experts suggest that these models be programmed with consideration for widely accepted human norms and rules for behavior.

To summarize, the key elements\nof our approach are:\nAutomated classification of messages.In the course of analysis, no one ever looked directly\nat the content of user messages: all of our analysis of the content of user messages is done\nthrough output of automated classifiers run on de-identified and PII-scrubbed usage data.\nAggregated employment data via a data clean room.We analyze and report aggregated\nemployment data through a secure data clean room environment: no one on the research\nteam had direct access to user-level demographic data and none of our analyses report\naggregates for groups with less than 100 users.\nIn following these measures, we aim to match or exceed the privacy protection precedents set by\nother social scientists studying chatbots and those linking digital platform data to external sources.\nWe follow the precedent established in recent analyses of chatbot conversations (Phang et al.\n(2025), Eloundou et al. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)) that rely on automated\nclassification rather than human inspection of raw transcripts. In particular, Phang et al. (2025)’s\nstudy of affective use of ChatGPT and Eloundou et al. (2025) investigation of first-person fairness in\nchatbots both analyze ChatGPT message content via automated classifiers and emphasize classifier-\nbased labeling as a scalable, privacy-preserving approach. Anthropic’s Handa et al. (2025) used a\nsimilar approach: theirCliomethodology applies automated classifiers to large collections of conver-\nsations, classifying conversations into thousands of topics, and in their appendix they describe manual\nvalidation on sampled conversations (100 user conversations flagged for review and 100 randomly sam-\npled calibrations). Like Eloundou et al., we validate our classifiers using WildChat, a public dataset\nof user conversations.\n9\x0cOther papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant\nprecedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for exam-\nple, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data.\nChetty et al. (2022) analyze de-identified Facebook friendship graphs and anonymized IRS tax records,\naggregated at the zip code level.\n']","Creative writing prompts, such as those suggesting stories or poems, encourage imaginative expression and can be generated through AI systems.

Its experts suggest that these models be programmed with consideration for widely accepted human norms and rules for behavior. AI algorithms need to take into effect the importance of these norms, how norm conflict can be resolved, and ways these systems can be transparent about norm resolution. Software designs should be programmed for “nondeception” and “honesty,” according to ethics experts. When failures occur, there must be mitigation mechanisms to deal with the consequences. In particular, AI must be sensitive to problems such as bias, discrimination, and fairness.68\nA group of machine learning experts claim it is possible to automate ethical decisionmaking. Using the trolley problem as a moral dilemma, they ask the following question: If an autonomous car goes out of control, should it be programmed to kill its own passengers or the pedestrians who are crossing the street? They devised a “voting-based system” that asked 1.3 million people to assess alternative scenarios, summarized the overall choices, and applied the overall perspective of these individuals to a range of vehicular possibilities. That allowed them to automate ethical decisionmaking in AI algorithms, taking public preferences into account.69 This procedure, of course, does not reduce the tragedy involved in any kind of fatality, such as seen in the Uber case, but it provides a mechanism to help AI developers incorporate ethical considerations in their planning.\n Penalize malicious behavior and promote cybersecurity\nAs with any emerging technology, it is important to discourage malicious treatment designed to trick software or use it for undesirable ends.70 This is especially important given the dual-use aspects of AI, where the same tool can be used for beneficial or malicious purposes. The malevolent use of AI exposes individuals and organizations to unnecessary risks and undermines the virtues of the emerging technology. This includes behaviors such as hacking, manipulating algorithms, compromising privacy and confidentiality, or stealing identities. Efforts to hijack AI in order to solicit confidential information should be seriously penalized as a way to deter such actions.71\nIn a rapidly changing world with many entities having advanced computing capabilities, there needs to be serious attention devoted to cybersecurity. Countries have to be careful to safeguard their own systems and keep other nations from damaging their security.72 According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a major American bank receives around 11 million calls a week at its service center. In order to protect its telephony from denial of service attacks, it uses a “machine learning-based policy engine [that] blocks more than 120,000 calls per month based on voice firewall policies including harassing callers, robocalls and potential fraudulent calls.”73 This represents a way in which machine learning can help defend technology systems from malevolent attacks.\n']","Creative writing prompts such as 'Create a short story about a time-traveling astronaut' or 'Make a rap in the style of Drake about the ocean' can be influenced by ethical guidelines for AI.

People will need the ability to think broadly about many questions and integrate knowledge from a number of different areas.\nOne example of new ways to prepare students for a digital future is IBM’s Teacher Advisor program, utilizing Watson’s free online tools to help teachers bring the latest knowledge into the classroom. They enable instructors to develop new lesson plans in STEM and non-STEM fields, find relevant instructional videos, and help students get the most out of the classroom.58 As such, they are precursors of new educational environments that need to be created.\n Create a federal AI advisory committee\nFederal officials need to think about how they deal with artificial intelligence. As noted previously, there are many issues ranging from the need for improved data access to addressing issues of bias and discrimination. It is vital that these and other concerns be considered so we gain the full benefits of this emerging technology.\nIn order to move forward in this area, several members of Congress have introduced the “Future of Artificial Intelligence Act,” a bill designed to establish broad policy and legal principles for AI. It proposes the secretary of commerce create a federal advisory committee on the development and implementation of artificial intelligence. The legislation provides a mechanism for the federal government to get advice on ways to promote a “climate of investment and innovation to ensure the global competitiveness of the United States,” “optimize the development of artificial intelligence to address the potential growth, restructuring, or other changes in the United States workforce,” “support the unbiased development and application of artificial intelligence,” and “protect the privacy rights of individuals.”59\nAmong the specific questions the committee is asked to address include the following: competitiveness, workforce impact, education, ethics training, data sharing, international cooperation, accountability, machine learning bias, rural impact, government efficiency, investment climate, job impact, bias, and consumer impact. The committee is directed to submit a report to Congress and the administration 540 days after enactment regarding any legislative or administrative action needed on AI.\nThis legislation is a step in the right direction, although the field is moving so rapidly that we would recommend shortening the reporting timeline from 540 days to 180 days. Waiting nearly two years for a committee report will certainly result in missed opportunities and a lack of action on important issues. Given rapid advances in the field, having a much quicker turnaround time on the committee analysis would be quite beneficial.\n']","Creative writing prompts, such as those suggesting to 'create a short story about a time-traveling astronaut' or 'compose a sonnet about time,' can be integrated into educational environments to foster critical thinking and creativity among students.

See Appendix for full cross-tabulations between GWA and two-digit SOC2 codes. 35 7 Conclusion This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics arePractical Guidance,Writing, andSeeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.Computer Pro- grammingandRelationships and Personal Reflectionaccount for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third,Writingis by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds ofWritingmessages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we callAsking, Doing,orExpressing.About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to', '<2-hop>\n\nCorporate\nusers may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise.\n28Very few work-related messages are classified asExpressing.\n29Appendix D contains a full report of GWA counts broken down by occupation, for both work-related ChatGPT\n31\x0cWe find remarkable similarity across occupations in how ChatGPT is used at work. For example,\nMaking Decisions and Solving Problemsis one of the two most common GWAs in every single oc-\ncupation group where at least two GWAs can be reported. 30 Similarly,Documenting and Recording\nInformationranks in the top four of all occupations.Thinking Creativelyis ranked as the third most\ncommon GWA in 10 of the 13 occupation groups where at least three GWAs can be reported. Even\nthough there are 41 GWAs, the seven most common overall are also the most common within each\noccupation group and are ranked similarly. Not surprisingly,Working with Computersis the most\ncommon GWA in computer-related occupations. In the appendix, we report the full distribution of\nGWA classifications intersected with two-digit SOC codes, as well as the most frequently requested\nGWAs out of the subset of queries which are work-related. Across all occupations, ChatGPT usage\nis broadly focused on seeking information and assistance with decision-making.\nusage and all ChatGPT usage.\n30For legal and food service occupations, we are only able to rank one of the GWAs because of user privacy protections\n- no other GWAs were requested by more than 100 users in that group.\n32\x0c Panel A.Work Related\n Panel B1.Asking.

Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025, more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related messages and forAskingrather thanDoingmessages at work. Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy. The fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI usage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to be paid$98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least$97 billion a year. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT as an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still, ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providingdecision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making.', '<3-hop>\n\n5.5 Quality of Interactions\nWe additionally used automated classifiers to study the user’s apparent satisfaction with the chatbot’s\nresponse to their request. OurInteraction Qualityclassifier looks for an expression of satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction in the user’s subsequent message in the same conversation (if one exists), with three\npossible categories:Good,Bad, andUnknown. 23\nFigure 16 plots the overall growth of messages in these three buckets. In late 2024Goodinteractions\nwere about three times as common asBadinteractions, butGoodinteractions grew much more rapidly\nover the next nine months, and by July 2025 they were more than four times more common.\nFigure 16:Interaction quality shares, based on automated sentiment analysis of thenext responseprovided\nby the user. See Appendix B to understand how this classifier was validated. Values are averaged over a 28\nday lagging window. Shares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations\nfrom May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a\ngiven day. Sampling details available in Section 3.\nDetails on the validation of this classifier, along with measurements of how it correlates with\nexplicit thumbs up/thumbs down annotations from users, are included in Appendix B.\nFigure 17 shows the ratio of good-to-bad messages by conversation topic and interaction type, as\nrated by Interaction Quality. Panel A shows thatSelf-Expressionis the highest rated topic, with a\ngood-to-bad ratio of more than seven, consistent with the growth in this category.Multimediaand\nTechnical Helphave the lowest good-to-bad ratios (1.7 and 2.7 respectively). Panel B shows that\nAskingmessages are substantially more likely to receive a good rating thanDoingorExpressing\nmessages.\n23For this classifier we do not disclose the prompt.\n23\x0cFigure 17:AverageGoodtoBadratio for user interactions by Conversation Topic (Panel A) and Ask-\ning/Doing/Expressing classification (Panel B).

This forces significant improvement to existing cyber defenses. Increasingly, vulnerable systems are migrating, and will need to shift to a layered approach to cybersecurity with cloud-based, cognitive AI platforms. This approach moves the community toward a “thinking” defensive capability that can defend networks through constant training on known threats. This capability includes DNA-level analysis of heretofore unknown code, with the possibility of recognizing and stopping inbound malicious code by recognizing a string component of the file. This is how certain key U.S.-based systems stopped the debilitating “WannaCry” and “Petya” viruses.\nPreparing for hyperwar and defending critical cyber networks must become a high priority because China, Russia, North Korea, and other countries are putting substantial resources into AI. In 2017, China’s State Council issued a plan for the country to “build a domestic industry worth almost $150 billion” by 2030.18 As an example of the possibilities, the Chinese search firm Baidu has pioneered a facial recognition application that finds missing people. In addition, cities such as Shenzhen are providing up to $1 million to support AI labs. That country hopes AI will provide security, combat terrorism, and improve speech recognition programs.19 The dual-use nature of many AI algorithms will mean AI research focused on one sector of society can be rapidly modified for use in the security sector as well.20\n Health care\nAI tools are helping designers improve computational sophistication in health care. For example, Merantix is a German company that applies deep learning to medical issues. It has an application in medical imaging that “detects lymph nodes in the human body in Computer Tomography (CT) images.”21 According to its developers, the key is labeling the nodes and identifying small lesions or growths that could be problematic. Humans can do this, but radiologists charge $100 per hour and may be able to carefully read only four images an hour. If there were 10,000 images, the cost of this process would be $250,000, which is prohibitively expensive if done by humans.\nWhat deep learning can do in this situation is train computers on data sets to learn what a normal-looking versus an irregular-appearing lymph node is. After doing that through imaging exercises and honing the accuracy of the labeling, radiological imaging specialists can apply this knowledge to actual patients and determine the extent to which someone is at risk of cancerous lymph nodes. Since only a few are likely to test positive, it is a matter of identifying the unhealthy versus healthy node.\nAI has been applied to congestive heart failure as well, an illness that afflicts 10 percent of senior citizens and costs $35 billion each year in the United States. AI tools are helpful because they “predict in advance potential challenges ahead and allocate resources to patient education, sensing, and proactive interventions that keep patients out of the hospital.”22\n']","Creative writing prompts can inspire innovative thinking in the development of AI solutions for healthcare. For instance, prompts like 'Create a short story about a time-traveling astronaut' can encourage healthcare professionals to think outside the box when designing AI applications that predict patient outcomes or improve medical imaging. By fostering creativity, these prompts can lead to unique app ideas that enhance decision-making processes, such as using AI to detect irregular lymph nodes in CT images, thereby improving efficiency and reducing costs associated with human radiologists. This integration of creativity and AI can ultimately lead to more effective healthcare solutions.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

For instance, if a user in the WildChat dataset was trying to generate a fictional short story, one human label might beDevelop news, entertainment, or artistic content, while another human label could beWrite material for artistic or commercial purposes. These two IWAs also belong to different GWAs despite being conceptually similar. B.1.5 Interaction Quality Classifier Human and model annotations of interaction quality are noisy. The classifier attains only slight agree- ment with the human plurality (Cohen’sκ= 0.14), below the likewise modest mean human–human agreement (κ= 0.20; Table 5). Figures 30 and 31 show weak concordance overall and a mild tendency for the model to assignBadless frequently than humans. This contrasts with our small development set, in which GPT-5 labeledBadmore often than humans. We retain this classifier because theseκ statistics primarily highlight the inherent difficulty of inferring the user’s latent satisfaction from text alone. While this latent “prior” is unobserved in our validation data, it is partially observable when users provide explicit thumbs-up/down feedback. To assess whether the classifier captures a signal aligned 56 Figure 30:Agreement Between Model and Plurality for Interaction Quality Figure 31:Bias Between Model and Plurality for Interaction Quality 57 with user experience, we link model predictions to voluntary feedback on assistant messages. We draw a 1-in-10,000 sample of conversations from June 2024 to June 2025 and retain cases where (i) the assistant message received explicit feedback and (ii) the user sent a subsequent message that our classifier can score, yielding roughly 60,000 eligible items. This is a restricted sample that may not be fully representative of all interactions, but it offers a unique lens on the classifier’s ability to proxy user satisfaction.']","Creative writing prompts can be effectively utilized in data analysis by encouraging analysts to think outside the box and present data in a more engaging narrative format.
