    "# Building blocks in Haystack: components and pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Haystack's architecture leverages components as its core elements, each performing specific functions like text processing or summarization. These components are designed to be connected into pipelines, which orchestrate the flow of data and manage task execution in a structured manner. The Pipeline class facilitates this by allowing the addition and connection of components, which must have unique input and output points for data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines are the backbone of NLP applications in Haystack, functioning as directed graphs where nodes are components and edges dictate data flow. They ensure smooth data processing, handle errors, and support debugging through visualization tools that help developers trace and optimize the data journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Haystack emphasizes modularity and flexibility, providing a range of pre-built components while also supporting custom ones for specific needs. The framework's pipelines enable the assembly of sophisticated NLP applications, integrating various functionalities into a cohesive system. In this notebook we will explore key components. In  the pipelines.ipynb notebook we will see how to connect them into pipelines."
