# Chapter 3: Introduction to Haystack by deepset

This repository contains exercises and interactive notebooks for Chapter 3, introducing Haystack's NLP pipeline and LLM orchestration framework.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):**
	```sh
	pip install uv
	```
2. **Install dependencies:**
	```sh
	uv sync
	```
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
	```sh
	source .venv/bin/activate
	```
4. **(Recommended) Open this `ch3` folder in a new VS Code window.**
5. **Select the virtual environment as the Jupyter kernel:**
	- Open any notebook.
	- Click the kernel picker (top right) and select the `.venv` environment.
